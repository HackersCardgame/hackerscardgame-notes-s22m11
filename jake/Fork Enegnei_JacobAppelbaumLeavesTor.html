Despite <a href="https://archive.is/1JYzf#selection-729.0-743.403" rel="nofollow">taking issue</a> with the "<a href="https://archive.is/taU8z" rel="nofollow">sensationalist</a>" <a href="https://archive.is/M7X9n" rel="nofollow">title</a> post-publication, as far as I'm aware he has never disclaimed the content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Appelbaum's obsession with privacy might be explained by 
the fact that, for his entire childhood, he had absolutely none of it. 
"I come from a family of lunatics," he says. "Actual, raving lunatics." 
His parents, who never married, began a 10-year custody battle before he
 was even born. He spent the first five years of his life with his 
mother, whom he says is a paranoid schizophrenic. She insisted that Jake
 had somehow been molested by his father while he was still in the womb.
 His aunt took custody of him when he was six; two years later she 
dropped him off at a Sonoma County children's home. It was there, at age
 eight, that he hacked his first security system. An older kid taught 
him how to lift the PIN code from a security keypad: You wipe it clean, 
and the next time a guard enters the code, you blow chalk on the pad and
 lift the fingerprints. One night, after everyone had gone to sleep, the
 boys disabled the system and broke out of the facility. They didn't do 
anything special — just walked around a softball field across the street
 for half an hour — but Appelbaum remembers the evening vividly: "It was
 really nice, for a single moment, to be completely free."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">When he was 10, he was assigned by the courts to live with
 his father, with whom he had remained close. But his dad soon started 
using heroin, and Appelbaum spent his teens traveling with his father 
around Northern California on Greyhound buses, living in Christian group
 homes and homeless shelters. From time to time, his father would rent a
 house and turn it into a heroin den, subletting every room to fellow 
addicts. All the spoons in the kitchen had burn stains. One morning, 
when Appelbaum went to brush his teeth, he found a woman convulsing in 
the bathtub with a syringe hanging out of her arm. Another afternoon, 
when he came home from school, he found a suicide note signed by his 
father. (Appelbaum saved him from an overdose that day, but his father 
died several years later under mysterious circumstances.) It got so that
 he couldn't even sit on a couch for fear that he'd be pierced by a 
stray needle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">An outsider in his own home, Appelbaum embraced outsider 
culture. He haunted the Santa Rosa mall, begging for change. He dressed 
in drag and "I <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="hearts" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2665.png"><img class="emoji" alt="hearts" src="Fork%20Enegnei_JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor_files/2665.png" width="20" height="20"></g-emoji>
 Satan" T-shirts, dyed his hair purple, picked fights with Christian 
fundamentalists and made out with boys in front of school. (Appelbaum 
identifies himself as "queer," though he refers to at least a dozen 
female lovers in nearly as many countries.) When a friend's father 
encouraged his interest in computers and taught him basic programming 
tools, something opened up for Appelbaum. Programming and hacking 
allowed him "to feel like the world was not a lost place. The Internet 
is the only reason I'm alive today."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">At 20, he moved to Oakland and eventually began providing 
tech security for the Rainforest Action Network and Greenpeace. In 2005,
 a few months after his father died, he traveled alone to Iraq — 
crossing the border by foot — and set up satellite Internet connections 
in Kurdistan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he drove to New 
Orleans, using falsified press documents to get past the National Guard,
 and set up wireless hot spots in one of the city's poorest 
neighborhoods to enable refugees to register for housing with FEMA.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Upon returning home, he started experimenting with the 
fare cards used by the Bay Area Rapid Transit system and discovered it 
was possible to rig a card with an unlimited fare. Instead of taking 
advantage, he alerted BART officials to their vulnerabilities. But 
during this conversation, Appelbaum learned that BART permanently stored
 the information encoded on every transit card — the credit-card number 
used, where and when they were swiped — on a private database. Appelbaum
 was outraged. "Keeping that information around is irresponsible," he 
says. "I'm a taxpayer, and I was given no choice how they store that 
data. It's not democratically decided — it's a bureaucratic directive."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Given his concerns about privacy, it's easy to see why 
Appelbaum gravitated toward the Tor Project. He volunteered as a 
programmer, but it soon became clear that his greatest ability lay in 
proselytizing: He projects the perfect mix of boosterism and dread. 
"Jake can do advocacy better than most," says Roger Dingledine, one of 
Tor's founders. "He says, 'If someone were looking for you, this is what
 they'd do,' and he shows them. It freaks people out."</p>

really crazy is that it's essentially the merging of these three things 
you're talking about. It was my right to travel freely, it was my 
ability to buy that plane ticket or for someone else to purchase that 
plane ticket, and it was the ability for me effectively to be able to 
speak — I was going to travel to speak somewhere, and in order to do 
that I had to make compromises in the other two spheres. And in fact it 
impacts my ability to speak, especially when I find out later what they 
have collected and that they've put it together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/leV3Z" rel="nofollow">Tonight I
 spoke with @carlbildt at the Stockholm City Hall - I asked him to 
support Julian Assange and Bradly Manning. He refused</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/9iGBh" rel="nofollow">I asked for clarification about why Sweden won't send people to question Julian in London as they do in other cases</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/ETf0r" rel="nofollow">I
 also asked if Sweden would extradite Julian Assange to the US when we 
operate death camps (eg: #gitmo) and have the death penalty</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/50sit" rel="nofollow">The response from @carlbildt was essentially that we all know what will happen to Julian Assange. Chilling</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/vtxq6" rel="nofollow">Does
 @carlbildt really represent #Sweden on this issue? Does Sweden really 
refuse to comment about extradition of journalists facing harm?</a> <a href="https://archive.is/Sp5Gm" rel="nofollow">There is a happy compromise to be made - #Sweden could easily question Julian in the Ecuadorian embassy - in service of justice</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/e3URg" rel="nofollow">By
 questioning Julian in the Ecuadorian Embassy, #Sweden will move the 
case forward. It also mitigates concerns of extradition to the US</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/Bo0XO" rel="nofollow">Julian 
and Manning are suffering injustice. @carlbildt has the power to speak 
out against their torture and the criminalizing of journalism</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/hqctU" rel="nofollow">Whenever
 one might say these things, politely and firmly, I encourage it. 
Especially when the people are powerful and the cause is Just</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/o92qK" rel="nofollow">I
 also asked about Anakata and how it was that he was kidnapped from 
Cambodia - I was told it was legal, though no specific law was cited</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/B7bq3" rel="nofollow">When
 we see that States are not proportional in how power is wielded, such 
as in the case of Manning, Anakata, and Assange, please speak up!</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/5jHKt" rel="nofollow">I should
 clarify, I was personally invited to the #SIF event at Stockholm City 
Hall tonight. I did not crash it looking for trouble</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/6uQyN" rel="nofollow">On
 Internet Freedom, we must remember that the cases of Manning, Anakata, 
and Assange are persecutions that chills speech on the internet</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">On December 27th 2012, founder <a href="https://archive.is/v8mHW" rel="nofollow">Asher Wolf</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf" rel="nofollow">@Asher_Wolf</a>) <a href="https://archive.is/OtPoB" rel="nofollow">quit as an organizer of <strong>CryptoParty</strong></a>, a <a href="https://archive.is/CK2kM" rel="nofollow">grassroots initiative to educate the general public</a> on <a href="https://archive.is/fjKhl" rel="nofollow">digital privacy-enhancing tools</a>, which at the time was <a href="https://archive.is/yrSKy" rel="nofollow">just four months old</a>. She said "<a href="https://archive.is/SJLQF" rel="nofollow">quitting wasn't easy</a>" and cited <a href="https://archive.is/OxmkN" rel="nofollow">a general lack of respect from several people in the movement who took advantage of <strong>CryptoParty</strong>'s decentralized structure</a>, which may have <a href="https://archive.is/nyDQo" rel="nofollow">put attendees at risk</a>. One day later she <a href="https://archive.is/lIRu1" rel="nofollow">published</a> a <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> with further explanation as to why she left. The 'final straw' was <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-555.0-623.76" rel="nofollow">a series of interactions</a> surrounding the <a href="https://archive.is/KoKyX" rel="nofollow"><strong>Chaos Communication Congress</strong> in December 2012</a> (29c3), particularly involving former <a href="https://archive.is/CQ8ju#selection-3195.66-3205.23" rel="nofollow">London <strong>CryptoParty</strong></a> <a href="https://archive.is/7Ds0w#selection-5079.1-5089.37" rel="nofollow">organizer</a> <a href="https://archive.is/4NWeP" rel="nofollow">Samuel Carlisle</a> (aka "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110716002931/http://samthetechie.com/index.php?id=Contact" rel="nofollow">Sam the Techie</a>"), who allegedly <a href="https://archive.is/oFutb" rel="nofollow">failed to complete a contract</a> of <a href="https://archive.is/Jc7Ct" rel="nofollow">building a website for her after she paid him AUS$700</a>. When he <a href="https://archive.is/ruwwk" rel="nofollow">traveled to Hamburg on December 24th</a> for his first Congress, as an <a href="https://archive.is/w5yXf#selection-887.1-903.11" rel="nofollow">Angel</a> <a href="https://archive.is/XiR8p" rel="nofollow">volunteer</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/eao8yBKHYT8?t=1h29m8s" rel="nofollow">Lightning Talk</a> speaker, she <a href="https://archive.is/L57QI" rel="nofollow">encouraged others</a> to <a href="https://archive.is/Sj67s" rel="nofollow">confront him</a> on her behalf. As a result of the <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-635.0-651.137" rel="nofollow">attention</a> on the dispute and <a href="https://archive.is/UiFOf" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="https://archive.is/ZW6we" rel="nofollow">controversy</a> over <a href="https://archive.is/Eup9E" rel="nofollow">someone's</a> <a href="https://archive.is/MkTzm" rel="nofollow">retaliation</a> for the "Creepercard" (<a href="https://archive.is/qTHN7" rel="nofollow">Red/Yellow card</a>) activity, Carlisle claims <a href="https://archive.is/ZdiNq#selection-945.0-945.253" rel="nofollow">he was removed from the volunteer team</a>. Wolf became a <a href="https://archive.is/9eGPN" rel="nofollow">doxing target</a>, which she implied was <a href="https://archive.is/HJOBY" rel="nofollow">his fault</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/KEPGx" rel="nofollow">Web developer</a> <a href="https://archive.is/JSxKP" rel="nofollow">Daniel Sieradski</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/7eFdH" rel="nofollow">@selfagency</a>) helped her <a href="https://archive.is/3mKfh" rel="nofollow">get it back online</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/kEdGU" rel="nofollow">finished creating the website</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-571.1-571.98" rel="nofollow">free of charge</a>. Despite Carlisle's <a href="https://archive.is/3O9Ib" rel="nofollow">public</a> <a href="https://archive.is/ZdiNq" rel="nofollow">apology</a>, Wolf's positive <a href="https://archive.is/uwy3t" rel="nofollow">reference letter</a> for <a href="https://archive.is/ZdiNq#selection-577.1-601.137" rel="nofollow">his MIT application</a> (as well as previous <a href="https://archive.is/OoLXJ#selection-599.1-599.244" rel="nofollow">commendation of his work for <strong>CryptoParty</strong></a>), <a href="https://archive.is/MqKBH#selection-5239.1-5239.49" rel="nofollow">offers</a> <a href="https://archive.is/ugixV" rel="nofollow">to</a> <a href="https://archive.is/BSMV1" rel="nofollow">refund</a> via <a href="https://archive.is/UKNGw" rel="nofollow">bank transfer</a>, and supposedly <a href="https://archive.is/lOh7Q#selection-6625.1-6625.101" rel="nofollow">more than one person</a> willing to <a href="https://archive.is/zvm4u" rel="nofollow">act as an intermediary</a>, the dispute was never resolved.</p>
<p dir="auto">Appelbaum was also <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-491.0-519.272" rel="nofollow">mentioned in her blog post</a> regarding a conversation they'd had on the <strong>Liberation Tech</strong> mailing list in early October, the topic of which was <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2012-October/005086.html" rel="nofollow">her technical abilities and willingness to learn</a>. In response to her assertion that she didn't "<a href="https://archive.is/xbGvm#selection-577.66-581.28" rel="nofollow">have the right skill set</a>," he encouraged her to not '<a href="https://archive.is/xbGvm#selection-597.49-601.72" rel="nofollow">demoralize</a>' herself, which she misinterpreted as criticism; he <a href="https://archive.is/r3kjk#selection-659.1-659.622" rel="nofollow">clarified</a> that <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-7119.0-7119.449" rel="nofollow">he believed in her willingness to learn</a>. She also <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-523.0-527.31" rel="nofollow">criticised his recommendation of PrivateGSM</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/x05hV" rel="nofollow">software for making encrypted phone calls</a>) at the first <strong>CryptoParty</strong> and how he backed out of teaching for the session. In the comments he explained that <a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-6929.0-6929.490" rel="nofollow">he'd had a new device</a> and wasn't able to "<a href="https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-7113.0-7113.466" rel="nofollow">hack it together</a>" in time. The misunderstanding was <a href="https://archive.is/LhRi2" rel="nofollow">resolved</a> again and she said his response was "<a href="https://archive.is/6pSjn#selection-3575.1-3575.96" rel="nofollow">supportive and constructive</a>." Following the end of the Congress, Appelbaum <a href="https://archive.is/nNIfy" rel="nofollow">organized a crowdfund</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130104094951/http://supportasherwolf.chipin.com/asherwolf-conflict-resolution" rel="nofollow">ChipIn</a> for Wolf to recover the AUS$700, <a href="https://archive.is/xTPO2" rel="nofollow">half of which he supposedly donated himself</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/bCeUR" rel="nofollow">I think we should raise $700 for @Asher_Wolf and then try to build consensus on future strategies for conflict resolutions.</a> <a href="https://archive.is/0aKZ9" rel="nofollow">While

 The difference is that in the second instance, the attack from the 
paper is implemented and practically demonstrated. After the first paper
 was published, many security researchers, including myself had the idea
 of actually implementing the attack. Kaminsky and friends also thought 
about doing this it seems and had started working on it (when?) with the
 goal of presenting at a conference and being recognised for basically 
the work of these famous cryptographers.</p>

Berlin right now because I had the really fucking awful, unfortunate

with manta rays and dolphins and all this other "unicorns and rainbows,"
 all that stuff. We didn't find any unicorns and rainbows- well, we 
actually found two rainbows, but no unicorns. So I was in Hawaii for my 
30th birthday in April, and twenty of my friends came. It was the most 
incredible thing I had ever experienced. If you want to feel loved, have
 twenty people fly for a really fucking long time to an island in the 
middle of an ocean, and to fly you there as a gift for your birthday. I 
felt really loved and I felt this was incredible; what a fantastic thing
 and what great friends. I'm so lucky to have friends like this in my

 a story -- let's say an analyst looking at your data trail because of a

surveillance. Because for a decade I have worked on these issues and 
finally we have the information, as you've seen in <strong>Der Spiegel</strong> recently and as you've seen in the <strong>Guardian</strong>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Over a span of several months prior to the <a href="https://archive.is/FQsDm" rel="nofollow"><strong>Chaos Communication Congress</strong></a> (31c3) in December 2014, <a href="https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25" rel="nofollow">core Tor developer</a> <a href="https://archive.is/yF1cg" rel="nofollow">Andrea Shepard</a> was the target of repeated online harassment.

<p dir="auto">Finally, in retaliation, Shepard published a blog post that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327134457/http://charon.persephoneslair.org/~andrea/pandorasts/jeremy_becker/" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> JbJabroni’s real name: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327134457/http://charon.persephoneslair.org/~andrea/pandorasts/jeremy_becker/" rel="nofollow">Jeremy Becker</a>, a pharmacist who lives with his parents in New Jersey. Becker has since deleted all his accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It’s unclear whether the doxxing will put a stop to 
Becker’s behavior. Shepard told Motherboard she hasn't been contacted by
 any of Becker's known accounts, but has no way of being sure if he’s 
not still harassing her under a new name as “he was part of a larger mob
 of deranged Pando followers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... In an email, Shepard admits doxxing to stop harassment
 is “not a reliable solution because a smarter harasser will always 
manage to conceal himself, but I'll take what I can get in the moment 
right now.”</p>

 that they also went to our funders and said, "What's this guy? What's

<p dir="auto">APPELBAUM: It is the case that there's a person in our

attack and have been deeply harassed. We think that sucks and we don't 
like that. Even though we promote anonymity without any question, that 
is no backdoors ever (and we'll get back to that in a minute), it is the
 case that we really want to promote being excellent to each other (in 
the spirit of Noisebridge). [...] It isn't the case that we're saying 
you shouldn't have the right to say things, but we are saying "get the 
fuck out of our community" if you're going to be abusive to women.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">And you'll note that I used the word "fuck" to say it; I'm
 sorry about that because the point is we all make mistakes and we want 
to make sure that, while it's true that we have transgressions, we want 
to make sure that we can find a place of reconciliation and we can work 
towards conflict resolution. It's important at the same time to 
recognize that there are people whose real lives are harmed by 
harassment online. In this case, one of the people is in this audience 
and I hope that they won't mind be named, but we want to give her a 
shout-out and say that we stand behind her a hundred percent.</p>

<p dir="auto">Based on a <a href="https://archive.is/5zlA0" rel="nofollow">letter</a> cited by <a href="https://archive.is/J7rxB" rel="nofollow"><strong>Golem.de</strong></a>, leaked through the anonymous blog site <a href="https://archive.is/aVULh" rel="nofollow"><strong>FearlessBlogging.com</strong></a>, <strong>Tor Project</strong>'s then <a href="https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-515.0-515.12" rel="nofollow">human relations manager</a> <a href="https://archive.is/rYKWV" rel="nofollow">Tom Leckrone</a> (who still <a href="https://archive.is/Of5TC" rel="nofollow">contributes to the mailing list</a>)
 wrote to Appelbaum on March 18th 2015 that he was "expected to 
engage... on performance and conduct issues" following "an unpaid 
suspension for a period of ten business days" from March 20th to 30th. 
The suspension was due to incidents which took place on March 3rd and 
6th during a <a href="https://archive.is/DrGwH" rel="nofollow">core Tor team company meeting</a> in <a href="https://blog.patternsinthevoid.net/valencia-spain.html" rel="nofollow">Valencia, Spain</a>, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731234252/http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/tor-funding-us-government/" rel="nofollow">one of the topics was reducing government funding</a>. (This was also the week of the <a href="https://archive.is/9klki" rel="nofollow"><strong>Circumvention Tech Festival</strong></a>, during which Appelbaum <a href="https://archive.is/ooFR7" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a> they needed help identifying a <a href="https://archive.is/tbdfC" rel="nofollow">suspicious GPS tracking device</a> found on an <a href="https://archive.is/KDYAy" rel="nofollow">attendee's</a> vehicle, and also when he claims <a href="https://archive.fo/3QWJF#selection-633.39-637.414" rel="nofollow">he and Macrina had sexual relations for the first time</a>.) The letter states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">As you know, a community member advanced a complaint that 
included two separate instances. One of the instances involved a 
provocative conversation on the afternoon of March 6th. The person to 
whom you were speaking was not offended, but the provocative 
conversation could be overheard by others and created an unwelcoming 
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The other incident raises more serious concerns regarding 
Tor Project’s obligation to ensure a safe and comfortable work 
environment, especially as regards an environment that is unwelcoming or
 hostile to protected classes of community members. In this case, you 
made statements that implied that new community members were recruited 
in a sexually charged manner. This was made during the course of a Tor 
Project-sanctioned work session which you took part in leading. The very
 statement that the inception of a working relationship was in any way 
influenced by sexual conduct or even innuendo is offensive, especially 
in an environment where Tor Project is actively working to ensure that 
all community members are able to engage and advance themselves based on
 their skills and willingness to contribute rather than other 
attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... In the repartee that followed, you expressly stated 
that the offensive sexualized recruitment “strategy” had “worked” with 
the complainant. This statement created an inappropriate and unwelcome 
environment for the complainant, and, indeed, any bystander who 
overheard this statement would be likely to perceive that the work 
environment at Tor Project was not welcoming and supportive of 
merit-based work.</p>

<p dir="auto">According to <a href="https://archive.is/wvbwZ" rel="nofollow"><strong>Buzzfeed</strong></a>, a person who made a complaint around this time was then <a href="https://archive.is/WTt5r#selection-673.0-673.34" rel="nofollow">Development Director Karen Reilly</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">She told [the board of the Tor Project] about Appelbaum’s 
public and false claims that he had sex with a specific member of the 
Tor community — something multiple sources have told BuzzFeed News 
Appelbaum has “done to too many people to count.” And she told them of 
darker allegations against him that had come up after a group of 
disgusted Tor community members gathered to share stories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">...According to sources, Appelbaum’s behavior had been the
 talk of the conference. Reilly had separately approached Lewman, 
Dingledine, Mathewson, and Seltzer in Valencia and told them of the 
harassment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">At dinner, the conversation turned to Appelbaum after 
Gardner, not yet a Tor employee, broached the subject. According to a 
source with knowledge of the dinner, Gardner said her friends had been 
asking her why she was working with an organization that employs a 
rapist. After that, Reilly “rehashed everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... Following the dinner, according to sources, Tor conducted a human resources inquiry into the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Like Appelbaum, Reilly was also given a ten-day suspension, but for "<a href="https://archive.is/wvbwZ#selection-2959.100-2959.217" rel="nofollow">spreading rumors about the <strong>Tor Project</strong></a>." It is not stated what kind of rumours, about whom, or by what <a href="https://archive.is/qMQU7" rel="nofollow">medium</a>. Unlike Appelbaum, she didn't take the offer and left permanently; no mention was made of her departure in <strong>Tor Project</strong> blog announcements. She is oddly not listed under 'past contributors,' while <a href="https://archive.is/RPj8I#selection-411.0-411.40" rel="nofollow">Lewman</a> is; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416074507/https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en" rel="nofollow">the last time</a> she appears on the <strong>Tor Project</strong> website is April 2015. As late as <a href="https://archive.is/w6DEK" rel="nofollow">October 2014</a>, Reilly had defended Tor for dealing effectively with these kinds of issues. A year later to the day, she wrote a <a href="https://archive.is/61e8T" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> reflecting that she now thought otherwise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If I had the power to remove the sexual harassers and 
misogynists from our midst, don’t you think I would have done so 
already? The problem is that I don’t have the power. If I worked for the
 sort of industry that removed awful men, I would have the power to 
remove awful men. If I say something, I’m the hysterical bitch who just 
wants to create drama. If I oppose an abuser openly, I become a target 
along with the people I care about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170705133010/https:/twitter.com/akareilly/status/882285615248789505?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Medium post</a> published on July 4th 2017, she wrote in the second-person about <a href="https://archive.is/WkCGk#selection-351.1-393.279" rel="nofollow">a conflict with an HR person at a tech organisation that led to resignation</a> and further employment issues. She may have been indicating that she has been under NDA with the <strong>Tor Project</strong>, hence the use of a detached grammatical person. On December 1st, in another <a href="https://archive.is/z6vuW#selection-395.21-401.85" rel="nofollow">Medium post</a>, she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Because when women build whisper networks to protect other
 women from rape, it’s called “spreading rumors.” Let’s call these 
things what they really are: an activist response to human rights 
violations, something leaders would be praising from a high stage at a 
conference if it wasn’t a response to their failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Between the 17th and 18th of March 2015, when Leckrone 
sent the suspension email, Reilly tweeted what is possibly a reference 
to the "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine#English" rel="nofollow">canary in the coal mine</a>" allusion:</p>

<p dir="auto">"<a href="https://archive.is/zhdGz" rel="nofollow">JTRIG</a>" is the acronym for a unit of GCHQ, the <strong>Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group</strong>,
 which uses psychological manipulation tactics to infiltrate and destroy
 activist groups by understanding, shaping, and controlling how 
discourse unfolds. The <strong>Human Science Operations Cell</strong> 
(HSOC) is a division of GCHQ which focuses on online human intelligence.
 Documents outlining their purpose and methods were among those <a href="https://archive.is/5v3pP" rel="nofollow">leaked by Edward Snowden</a> and subsequently published through media outlets with access to the archives. In <a href="https://archive.is/kDzXc" rel="nofollow">February 2014</a>, <a href="https://archive.fo/tw8CD" rel="nofollow">co-founding journalist and constitutional lawyer</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160905184955/https:/twitter.com/ggreenwald" rel="nofollow">Glenn Greenwald</a> released a series of documents on JTRIG, including "<a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/" rel="nofollow">The Art of Deception: Training for a New Generation of Online Covert Operations</a>,"
 in which they outline their goals to create "cyber magicians" who can 
manipulate targets at individual, group, and global levels using social 
psychology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: <strong>(1)</strong> to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and <strong>(2)</strong>
 to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online 
discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To 
see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they 
boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting 
material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), 
fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual 
whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative 
information” on various forums.</p>

The documents detailed how the U.S. Justice Department forced <strong>Google</strong> to turn over "<a href="https://archive.is/9972D#selection-359.72-359.148" rel="nofollow">more than one year's worth of data from the Gmail account of Jacob Appelbaum</a>" under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160721170712/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703" rel="nofollow">18 U.S. Code § 2703</a>, including a gag to prevent <strong>Google</strong> "<a href="https://archive.is/9972D#selection-363.116-363.194" rel="nofollow">from notifying Appelbaum that his records had been provided to the government</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/9972D#selection-371.0-371.545" rel="nofollow">According
 to the unsealed documents, the Justice Department first sought details 
from Google about a Gmail account operated by Appelbaum in January 2011,
 triggering a three-month dispute between the government and the tech 
giant. Government investigators demanded metadata records from the 
account showing email addresses of those with whom Appelbaum had 
corresponded between the period of November 2009 and early 2011; they 
also wanted to obtain information showing the unique IP addresses of the
 computers he had used to log in to the account.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Google</strong> argued that providing such records not only violated Appelbaum's Fourth Amendment right but his <a href="https://archive.is/9972D#selection-381.196-381.544" rel="nofollow">First Amendment right as a journalist</a> (see <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p11" rel="nofollow">pgs 10-11 under "The Order May Raise Significant Free Speech and Other Privilege Issues" of Attachment A</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">To the extent that the Gmail user [redacted] is a 
journalist or engaged in other constitutionally protected activities, 
the user may wish to assert First Amendment rights or any applicable 
journalist, academic or other privileges or defenses to which the user 
is entitled. Google is not properly positioned to do so on behalf of 
users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The Justice Department argued that Appelbaum had “<a href="https://archive.is/9972D#selection-375.47-375.122" rel="nofollow">no reasonable expectation of privacy</a>” over his email records, where the Order "simply requires disclosure of 'non-content' information" (see <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p43" rel="nofollow">pg 8 under "The Order is Constitutional" of Attachment B</a>), and also <a href="https://archive.is/9972D#selection-387.199-387.253" rel="nofollow">didn't acknowledge him as being a journalist</a>. They considered the nondisclosure provision to be necessary because "unsealing and permitting disclosure of the <strong>Twitter</strong> Order has already seriously jeopardized the investigation" (see <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p38" rel="nofollow">pgs 3-4 under "Argument"</a> or <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p46" rel="nofollow">pgs 11-16 of Attachment B</a>), referring to the <a href="https://archive.is/9972D#selection-395.0-402.0" rel="nofollow">public controversy following their other Order to <strong>Twitter</strong> for the same data</a> (see <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p6" rel="nofollow">pgs 5-7 under "Procedural Posture" of Attachment A</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The Twitter Order was issued on December 14, 2010 and 
relates to the ongoing Wikileaks investigation, which is obviously an 
issue of great public interest. The Twitter Order demanded the 
production of subscriber information and certain records and other 
non-content information for a number of Twitter account holders from 
November 1, 2009 to the present, including an account with the user name
 [redacted]. It also contained a non-disclosure provision. The grand 
jury investigation underlying the Twitter Order was widely reported in 
the <em>New York Times</em> and other media outlets around the time the 
Twitter Order was issued. Indeed, prior to issuance of the order, the 
Attorney General had acknowledged that the government was actively 
investigating Wikileaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... On January 4, 2011, the day after the government 
agreed to unseal the Twitter Order, it procured from this Court the 
Order in this matter, which is substantially identical to the Twitter 
Order and compels Google to produce the idential information as the 
Twitter Order for the Google Gmail account [redacted]. The perpetual 
nondisclosure provision in the order is identical to the Twitter Order 
nondisclosure provision.</p>

particularly at <strong>The Guardian</strong>, the "<a href="https://archive.is/FrTlr#selection-1729.0-1743.1" rel="nofollow">shittiest publication in the English language</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Some of you have written things in papers, for example, 
where you call me, or Julian Assange, or Sarah Harrison, 'internet 
activists'. To you that have done that, I think that you do not 
understand potentially what you do and, in that case, I have some 
forgiveness for you. But for those of you that do, I understand that you
 think me your political enemy and I take that up quite seriously, and I
 will win. So, with that in mind, I don't call you a 'grammar activist.'</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">But I would say that it is important that if we have 
'disclosure activists' in the audience, I think it's important to 
consider, for example, that when we have bylines together in papers and 
later you call me an 'internet activist', it's important to remember you
 should probably have disclosed in your article where you called me an 
'internet activist' that, actually, we were co-authors on, for example, 
the equivalent of the German Pulitzer Prize, or something similar to 
that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">To call me a 'political activist' is to consciously put me
 outside of the political tent of privilege and to say: go ahead, 
instead of being under <em>journalism law</em>, you're under <em>terrorism law</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">At a previous <a href="https://archive.is/zUnVw" rel="nofollow">CIJ Symposium</a> in December 2014, he had similarly said "<a href="https://youtu.be/Azha-9ocdbU?t=132" rel="nofollow">every effective journalist is an activist... for the truth</a>."</p>

<p dir="auto">In <a href="https://archive.is/UNxr6" rel="nofollow">early April 2016</a>, Appelbaum visited North Korea for <a href="https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-1113.0-1113.43" rel="nofollow">seven days</a> as part of a guided tour group of nine other Americans with the <a href="https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-1077.69-1077.105" rel="nofollow">Korean International Travel Company</a>, supposedly after <a href="https://archive.is/fXuKk" rel="nofollow">receiving offers</a> sometime in <a href="https://archive.is/z4M1R" rel="nofollow">January</a>.

 between the 26th and 27th of June (Vimeo later took it down, but I had 
saved an .mp4 copy). Other than Appelbaum making an appearance, what is

<p dir="auto">On June 2nd, 2016, Steele posted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213021/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project" rel="nofollow">"transition" update</a> on the organization's blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Long time digital advocate, security researcher, and 
developer Jacob Appelbaum stepped down from his position at The Tor 
Project on May 25, 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Within the same day that Steele announced Appelbaum's departure, Shepard <a href="https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-26133.0-26133.78" rel="nofollow">revealed the hash input</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">(To verify this yourself using OpenSSL, input <code>echo It seems one rapist is one rapist too many | openssl sha256</code>, the output of which should be <code>(stdin)= bfb9a7c833a5fc8f5a938d816b1bbc4acaa06519fdb1af4c8632719596807dac</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Shortly before the transition update was published, Dingledine allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628002000/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/dingledine-appelbaum-16-0602.pdf" rel="nofollow">sent out an email to the Tor-internal mailing list</a> with more detail about Appelbaum's resignation (<a href="https://archive.is/u6iOS" rel="nofollow">originally leaked on June 5th</a>, it was later <a href="https://archive.is/bylE6" rel="nofollow">republished</a> and mirrored by <a href="https://archive.is/isP0T#selection-269.0-268.1" rel="nofollow"><strong>Cryptome.org</strong></a> on <a href="https://archive.is/4vY5N" rel="nofollow">June 27th</a>). The email outlined who would be the <a href="https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.5302-215.5597" rel="nofollow">points of contact</a>, reassured them they were still working on <a href="https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.5599-215.6201" rel="nofollow">drafting documents for company and community policy</a>, that <a href="https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.6203-215.6565" rel="nofollow">Tor-the-company would survive this</a>, and urged them to "<a href="https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.7704-215.7737" rel="nofollow">be mindful</a>" about how they talked to the public or engaged in "<a href="https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.7820-215.7830" rel="nofollow">twitterwar</a>." No one from Tor has yet confirmed whether the email is authentic.</p>
<p dir="auto">A few days later, Appelbaum's name was <a href="https://archive.is/yxqlC" rel="nofollow">removed from the list</a> of core <strong>Tor Project</strong> employees and volunteers, then added to '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823164626/https://www.torproject.org/about/contributors.html.en" rel="nofollow">past contributors</a>.'

<p dir="auto">However, he still appeared to <a href="https://archive.is/K93V5" rel="nofollow">have control over his Tor directory authority</a>. On July 1st, Dingledine emailed a plan to drop 'urras', a process which requires <a href="https://archive.is/LzgfS#selection-83.785-83.895" rel="nofollow">at least five</a> of the <a href="https://archive.is/7lJ4c" rel="nofollow">nine other directory authorities</a> to agree in consensus, including <a href="https://archive.is/LzgfS#selection-83.1243-83.1354" rel="nofollow">at least one of three DAs which votes on recommended versions</a>: '<a href="https://archive.is/V0WKc" rel="nofollow">moria1</a>' controlled by Dingledine, '<a href="https://archive.is/EaZdS" rel="nofollow">gabelmoo</a>' controlled by <a href="https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-367.0-367.25" rel="nofollow">developer</a> <a href="https://archive.is/HESIE" rel="nofollow">Sebastian Hahn</a> (shown to be <a href="https://archive.is/gU88G#selection-1699.0-1705.154" rel="nofollow">targeted by the NSA's XKeyscore program</a> in <a href="https://archive.is/Xx4hr" rel="nofollow">2014</a>), and '<a href="https://archive.is/OiSgs" rel="nofollow">tor26</a>' controlled by <a href="https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-647.0-647.39" rel="nofollow">sysadmin and developer</a> <a href="https://archive.is/UwKjE" rel="nofollow">Peter Palfrader</a>.

<p dir="auto">As people responded to the news about Appelbaum as well as

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">As background to her assertion that he "graduated [from 
plagiarist] to sexual assault," it would be relevant to note that 
Patterson and Appelbaum have a history of being involved in plagiarism 
disputes since 2008 (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#len-sassaman-and-plagiarism-allegations"><em>Len Sassaman and Plagiarism Allegations</em></a>'). She <a href="https://archive.is/xuuCG" rel="nofollow">tweeted her account</a> of an interaction with Appelbaum which followed that alleged dispute, and then said that "<a href="https://archive.is/laWvR" rel="nofollow">Jake
 hasn't apologised to any of his assault/harassment victims that I know 
of either. And to everyone else trying to make hay out of that 
distinction, hairsplitting isn't a good look on you</a>." Auernheimer replied to Patterson's thread, saying "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730050805/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/739820793681588224" rel="nofollow">plagiarism is a more serious allegation than rape to me personally</a>... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730045417/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/739820216226615296" rel="nofollow">The bug Jake stole from Len was awesome. Once in a lifetime kind of stuff. Irreplaceable.</a>" These kinds of comments were neither new nor discouraged (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#online-harassment-of-the-tor-project"><em>Online Harassment of the Tor Project</em></a>').</p>
<p dir="auto">American journalist <a href="https://archive.is/GIttq" rel="nofollow">Quinn Norton</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/vmHXz" rel="nofollow">former partner of Aaron Swartz</a>, later also <a href="https://archive.is/5Sywt" rel="nofollow">claimed involvement in plagiarism disputes</a>
 with Appelbuam. They have yet to directly specify, or present evidence 
of, what work he plagiarised. In Patterson's case she probably won't 
ever do so, since she's <a href="https://archive.is/q4PbR" rel="nofollow">already told Leidl</a> (who <a href="https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3485.1-3485.118" rel="nofollow">challenged how she defined 'plagiarism'</a>) that "<a href="https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3131.7-3131.98" rel="nofollow">when research that gets stolen was only communicated about orally, there is no paper trail</a>." <a href="https://archive.is/AK00O" rel="nofollow">Kaminsky</a> was also <a href="https://archive.is/qkoTS#selection-4929.1-4929.97" rel="nofollow">unwilling to provide details</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614234138/https://crypto.cat/mission.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Cryptocat</strong></a> developer <a href="https://archive.is/CIb0I" rel="nofollow">Nadim Kobeïssi</a> has also <a href="https://archive.is/ub4CH" rel="nofollow">argued with Appelbaum</a> in the past with regards to <a href="https://archive.is/VlKC6" rel="nofollow">attribution rights</a>, but outside of <a href="https://archive.is/GW6T0" rel="nofollow">one tweet</a> on the subject has stayed out of the debate because he "<a href="https://archive.is/tPnaQ" rel="nofollow">thought a bit more about things and decided I had better things to emotionally invest myself in than an angry riot</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">The majority of those who responded were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033907/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738801590333624320" rel="nofollow">shocked and/or asked for more information</a>, both about the rape allegations and the circumstances of Appelbaum stepping down, which the <strong>Tor Project</strong> only said was a "<a href="https://archive.fo/Qs6va#selection-1737.10-1737.79" rel="nofollow">personnel matter</a>." According to <strong>Süddeutsche Zeitung</strong>, the Berlin Public Prosecution Office was not aware of any claims to date against Appelbaum ("<a href="https://archive.is/5D41r#selection-2189.168-2189.267" rel="nofollow">Die Berliner Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt nach eigenen Angaben bislang nicht gegen Jacob Appelbaum</a>").</p>
<p dir="auto">On June 4th, Steele <a href="https://archive.is/uOTpp" rel="nofollow">released a longer public statement</a>
 about the situation. Though it did confirm that the allegations led to 
Appelbaum stepping down, it did not reveal any more details, only that 
the matter was being investigated with the help of "a legal firm that 
specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Over the past several days, a number of people have made 
serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project
 employee Jacob Appelbaum. These types of allegations were not entirely 
new to everybody at Tor; they were consistent with rumors some of us had
 been hearing for some time. That said, the most recent allegations are 
much more serious and concrete than anything we had heard previously. We
 are deeply troubled by these accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We do not know exactly what happened here. We don't have 
all the facts, and we are undertaking several actions to determine them 
as best as possible. We're also not an investigatory body, and we are 
uncomfortable making judgments about people's private behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">That said, after we talked with some of the complainants, 
and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped 
down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project.</p>

<p dir="auto">Appelbaum's last message, prior to these allegations going public, was a tweet on the day he supposedly left the <strong>Tor Project</strong>: "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605180001/https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/736259103790632960" rel="nofollow">Changing of the guards</a>." He remained publicly silent until June 6th, when he <a href="https://archive.is/YZ2co" rel="nofollow">issued a statement</a> using <a href="https://archive.is/I7Zhd" rel="nofollow">TwitLonger</a>,
 both to say that the allegations against him where "entirely false" and
 the "vicious and spurious" way they were delivered has made him 
"prepared to use legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation 
from these libelous accusations." The reputational damage from the 
allegations began to take effect in the following weeks as he was <a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-public-reaction">removed from participation, membership, and advisory positions in several organisations</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">An international film publicist, <a href="https://archive.is/eHxMD" rel="nofollow">Claudia Tomassini</a>, told <strong>WIRED</strong> that Appelbaum's "<a href="https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1511.239-1511.444" rel="nofollow">legal team is working on an injunction against these monstrous and factually incorrect accusations</a>." According to <strong>The Daily Dot</strong> she "<a href="https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1039.170-1039.350" rel="nofollow">walked back that statement</a>," instead <a href="https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-1115.0-1123.169" rel="nofollow">saying</a>
 he “deserves as fair a hearing as anybody who comes forward with 
grievances against him.” She also clarified that Appelbaum was not her 
client; her involvement with him arose out of one of her <a href="https://archive.is/XbC4k" rel="nofollow">media publicity projects</a>, the '<a href="https://archive.is/BZUi0" rel="nofollow"><em>Risk</em></a>' documentary (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#festival-de-cannes"><em>Festival de Cannes</em></a>' and '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#laura-poitras"><em>Laura Poitras</em></a>').</p>

 who was addressed by the pseudonym of "River." This was the first time

 that as a person in a leadership role, he made many mistakes and hurt

unconscious. Nor did I have sex with someone who was in any way 
intoxicated in order to obtain consent."</a></p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>DIE ZEIT</strong> noted again that "<a href="https://archive.is/gbw90#selection-927.187-927.304" rel="nofollow">there have been no reports of charges by victims or investigations by police or public prosecutors against Appelbaum</a>," and <a href="https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1255.148-1255.285" rel="nofollow">Appelbaum hadn't gone to police either</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810151016/https://twitter.com/kappuchino" rel="nofollow">Sebastian Mondial</a>, a <a href="https://archive.is/1FA9p" rel="nofollow"><strong>DIE ZEIT</strong> investigative researcher</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810160132/https://www.icij.org/journalists/sebastian-mondial" rel="nofollow">data journalist</a>, tweeted about his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810151836/https://twitter.com/kappuchino/status/763332467382247424" rel="nofollow">involvement in the investigation</a>.

<p dir="auto">On July 25th 2016, the <strong>Tor Project</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160725231550/http://gizmodo.com/tor-concludes-applebaum-investigation-will-release-new-1784235523?rev=1469454977173" rel="nofollow">announced via <strong>Gizmodo</strong> that their two-month "external investigation" had concluded</a>. Steele did not give details on what the findings or conclusions were, only saying that they would "<a href="https://archive.is/4JWMx#selection-1393.80-1393.183" rel="nofollow">release the general findings of the investigation as well as new guidelines regarding sexual harassment</a>" "<a href="https://archive.is/4JWMx#selection-1549.52-1555.17" rel="nofollow">exclusively to <em>The New York Times</em> later this week</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Steele told Gizmodo that the Tor Project has no plans to 
bring any of the sexual assault claims to law enforcement, but said that
 she can’t speak for the individual victims. The external probe, 
conducted by a lawyer who specializes in sexual assault investigations, 
interviewed more than six people who claimed to be victims of 
Appelbaum’s abuse or to have witnessed it. According to one woman 
interviewed as part of the probe, the investigator conducted multiple 
interviews over a period of two months.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">“We were especially looking at the accusations against 
Jacob Appelbaum and also looking to see if there were any broader long 
term implications for the broader community,” Steele told Gizmodo. She 
said the investigation also looked at whether the Tor Project held any 
liability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Gizmodo</strong> claims to have also interviewed an anonymous source "<a href="https://archive.is/4JWMx#selection-1543.123-1543.158" rel="nofollow">with knowledge of the investigation</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">People inside the Tor Project are still deliberating what 
Tor’s statement regarding the report will say, though one source with 
knowledge of the investigation said that the report will not use the 
word “rape.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727185617/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/758326879673724928" rel="nofollow">July 27th</a>, Steele <a href="https://archive.is/lkywt" rel="nofollow">announced directly from the Tor blog</a> that the investigation had concluded. Due to the "<a href="https://archive.is/lkywt#selection-121.0-121.36" rel="nofollow">sensitive</a>"
 nature of the information, she did not disclose who was involved in the
 investigation or clarify what "unwanted sexually aggressive behavior" 
was found to have occurred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">"... <a href="https://archive.is/lkywt#selection-117.12-117.364" rel="nofollow">A
 number of people have come forward with first-person accounts and other
 information. The Tor Project hired a professional investigator, and she
 interviewed many individuals to determine the facts concerning the 
allegations. The investigator worked closely with me and our attorneys, 
helping us to understand the overall factual picture as it emerged</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... <a href="https://archive.is/lkywt#selection-129.0-129.314" rel="nofollow">The
 investigation is now complete. Many people inside and outside the Tor 
Project have reported incidents of being humiliated, intimidated, 
bullied and frightened by Jacob, and several experienced unwanted 
sexually aggressive behavior from him. Some of those incidents have been
 shared publicly, and some have not.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Steele also claims that they found "two additional people 
as having engaged in inappropriate conduct, and they are no longer 
involved with the Tor Project." She did not identify these individuals 
or what their "inappropriate conduct" consisted of, only telling <strong>The New York Times</strong> that they "<a href="https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2157.88-2157.264" rel="nofollow">had also been involved in the incidents</a>" and "<a href="https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2243.44-2243.83" rel="nofollow">we won’t tolerate this behavior anymore</a>." <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727172736/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/tor-inquiry-many-people-reported-being-humiliated-by-appelbaum/" rel="nofollow">Krauss was contacted directly on the subject by <strong>Ars Technica</strong></a> but she also <a href="https://archive.is/aLPTA#selection-2163.0-2169.80" rel="nofollow">refused to give their names</a>. <strong>The Daily Dot</strong> claims to have spoken with anonymous sources who say the individuals, both male, left "<a href="https://archive.is/AqZfG#selection-1267.277-1267.298" rel="nofollow">more than a month ago</a>" and were not accused of assault.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/AqZfG#selection-1267.123-1267.410" rel="nofollow">Sources
 with knowledge of the investigation told the Daily Dot that the project
 cut ties with the two men, only one of whom was an actual project 
member, more than a month ago. The two U.S.-based developers, 
unidentified by the Tor Project, are not accused of assault, the sources
 said.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">According to <strong>BuzzFeed</strong>, the two men will be <a href="https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3149.0-3149.166" rel="nofollow">reintegrated</a> into the Tor community by <strong>Tor Project</strong>'s new Community Team and Council; Macrina, who <a href="https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3143.107-3143.507" rel="nofollow">leads the Community Team and is a member of the Community Council</a>, has been <a href="https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3155.0-3155.198" rel="nofollow">recused from this effort</a> after <a href="https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3149.167-3155.198" rel="nofollow">two core Tor members</a> pointed out the conflict of interest (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#alison-macrina"><em>Alison Macrina</em></a>'). She claimed that because the Community Team is unpaid, they <a href="https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3155.199-3155.363" rel="nofollow">do not have access to the investigation results</a>; to this day, the <strong>Tor Project</strong> has not shared the investigation procedures or results publicly.</p>

 Other than repeating what Steele said in the blog post, she claims to 
have also spoken with an anonymous source with regards to Appelbaum's 
absence in what turned out to be a one-sided investigation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2163.0-2163.164" rel="nofollow">Mr.
 Appelbaum was preparing to address the results of the investigation 
after the release of Tor’s statement, said a person who spoke on the

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... <a href="https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2207.0-2207.406" rel="nofollow">Mr.
 Appelbaum did not participate in the Tor investigation, citing concerns
 with the way the findings would be communicated and the security of the
 investigation, according to the person who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. Mr. Appelbaum had asked that Tor’s investigators speak with 
him in person or through encrypted means and declined to take part when 
those requests were not met, this person said.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>Tor Project</strong> later tweeted about the 
use of encryption during the investigation. It is unclear if this is a 
refutation of Perlroth's article or if these options were only offered 
to alleged victims and witnesses, but not Appelbaum.</p>

 It is unclear why Steele is relunctant to use the word "rape" if those

 and promoted the victim website (you can tell it's the same account

<p dir="auto">Under the 'Victims' header of the original version of the 
"victims collective" website, it at first appeared to be filled with 
random speeches, though it was likely default filler text since it is 
used on at least two other websites: <a href="https://archive.is/1c355" rel="nofollow">this blog</a> and the 'Manifest' section of <a href="https://archive.is/7E2T4#selection-211.0-211.12" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, with nearly identical <a href="https://archive.is/mVZ9E" rel="nofollow">theme code</a> that the "victims collective" website seems to have copied.</p>
<p dir="auto">Shepard is one of the suspected creators of the site. She tweeted that it was not her "<a href="https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-3557.1-3557.98" rel="nofollow">choice to keep the sources this vague, but frankly, people are afraid of retaliation</a>."
 (I'm assuming she means retaliation from people other than Appelbaum; 
for any allegations which are true, the level of detail in the stories 
would enable him to identify the claimant from memory and thus defeat 
the attempt at anonymity. This implies Appelbaum himself is not able, or
 has no desire, to deanonymise them publicly). She <a href="https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1517.163-1517.350" rel="nofollow">told <strong>WIRED</strong></a>
 that the creator was a "longtime member of the Tor community” whom she 
knows and trusts. She has also speculated that Appelbaum created the <a href="https://archive.is/tHhxh" rel="nofollow">@VictimsOfJake</a> account to smear himself "<a href="https://archive.is/VdYGT#selection-3903.7-3903.70" rel="nofollow">for sympathy</a>." Another <a href="https://archive.is/Xd2qF#selection-4323.6-4323.19" rel="nofollow">likely candidate</a> is Lovecruft (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#isis-lovecruft"><em>Isis Lovecruft</em></a>'), who said "<a href="https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-187.0-187.68" rel="nofollow">I first started seeking out other victims, about six months ago,</a>" which would also explain their strange dating (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#alleged-victims"><em>Alleged Victims</em></a>'). <a href="https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-575.0-575.24" rel="nofollow">Alison Macrina</a>, like <a href="https://archive.is/dE85n#selection-3971.74-3971.98" rel="nofollow">Shepard</a>, has said the account is a "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605165004/https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739146421023084544" rel="nofollow">troll</a>" and "should be reported. [T]hey do not represent any of the victims I've talked to." (The @VictimsOfJake account <a href="https://archive.is/1QraI" rel="nofollow">responded</a> by calling her a "social manipulator," yet later <a href="https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.1762-215.2116" rel="nofollow">appears to support her</a>.) She <a href="https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1011.0-1019.230" rel="nofollow">told <strong>The Daily Dot</strong></a> that she "<a href="https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1015.274-1015.339" rel="nofollow">vouched for the authenticity of the anonymous victims’ statements</a>"
 and, like Shepard and an unnamed Tor employee, knows who is behind the 
website. It is entirely possible that all three could be directly 
involved with the website's creation and updates, due to their open 
admissions of having knowledge of the allegations for at least a few 
months.</p>
<p dir="auto">Besides the stories themselves, the most alarming aspects 
of the "victims collective" website were the signs of bad faith, not 
only in the use of his name and slight variations of his handle for 
accounts, but also the initial tweet button which prompted people to 
share the website as if it was owned by Appelbaum, tagging his real 
handle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I just read on <a href="https://twitter.com/ioerror" rel="nofollow">@ioerror</a>'s homepage <a href="https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net" rel="nofollow">https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net</a> that he has sexually assaulted many people in #tech. #wtf</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The site's FAQ now claims that they are "<a href="https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-865.22-865.66" rel="nofollow">a small group of people of different genders</a>" who "<a href="https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1189.113-1189.272" rel="nofollow">never
 meant to impersonate Jake or to trick anyone. With the official text, 
we have tried to make it clear that it isn't pretending to be made by 
Jake himself</a>." However they are still linking to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608011441/https://github.com/ioerror" rel="nofollow">real GitHub account</a> at the bottom of the page, their contact email is <strong><a href="mailto:ioerror@riseup.net">ioerror@riseup.net</a></strong>, and the file for the website's header image is "<a href="https://archive.fo/lKNTB" rel="nofollow">me.jpg</a>." The new tweet prompt text is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I just read on <a href="https://jacobappelbaum.net/" rel="nofollow">https://jacobappelbaum.net</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/ioerror" rel="nofollow">@ioerror</a> has sexually assaulted many people in #tech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1249.153-1249.432" rel="nofollow">last part of the FAQ</a>
 states: "We do not believe that Jake is likely to ever face criminal 
charges. We know that some people will say that proves that the stories 
here aren't true. But we know that many people understand we are telling
 the truth, and we believe people will be safer because we made this 
site."</p>
<p dir="auto">The second account, "<a href="https://archive.is/cFDr1" rel="nofollow">@Ioerror_info</a>," was made several days later. On June 9th, its first tweet was an alternative version of a story published by <strong>Gizmodo</strong> and <strong>The Daily Dot</strong> (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#emerson-tan-patterson-shepard-and-hirsch"><em>Emerson Tan, Patterson, Shepard, and Hirsch</em></a>'). Like the first account, it is not publicly known who is behind it.</p>
<p dir="auto">On the same day, <a href="https://archive.is/bLpyX" rel="nofollow">Australian</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514192714/https://risky.biz/about/" rel="nofollow">podcaster</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514192221/https:/twitter.com/riskybusiness" rel="nofollow">Patrick Gray</a> tweeted a '<a href="https://archive.is/fUh8D" rel="nofollow">Downfall</a>' parody captioned to represent Appelbaum reacting to the allegations. Gray said this meme had been "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514191856/https:/twitter.com/riskybusiness/status/740998683412594688?lang=en" rel="nofollow">doing the rounds</a>" in private conversation; Shepard and other Tor contributors, including <a href="https://archive.is/VWsIV#selection-167.0-167.24" rel="nofollow">developer</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514201514/https://twitter.com/abditum" rel="nofollow">Griffin Boyce</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514201621/https://twitter.com/kencf0618" rel="nofollow">Kenneth Freeman</a>,
 either liked or shared the tweet. Replies to the tweet were generally 
disapproving, though no one pointed out that it was in very poor taste 
particularly because Appelbaum comes from a Jewish background (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#online-harassment-of-the-tor-project"><em>Online Harassment of the Tor Project</em></a>').</p>
<p dir="auto">The third account, "<a href="https://archive.is/Xfipv" rel="nofollow">@JakeTheRaper</a>," was made on June 14th. It mutually followed <a href="https://archive.is/ToNmk" rel="nofollow">an account</a> which has been amplifying anti-Appelbaum tweets, especially those with a <a href="https://archive.is/qFfnZ" rel="nofollow">mock-solidarity button</a> which <a href="https://archive.is/gUCRQ" rel="nofollow">Shepard</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801160542/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/742001087952093184" rel="nofollow">Macrina</a> also liked. It linked to a <a href="https://archive.is/9x9qC" rel="nofollow">GitHub repository</a> that was created on <a href="https://archive.is/3PK07" rel="nofollow">June 12th</a>, run by <a href="https://archive.is/V715e" rel="nofollow">Caleb James DeLisle</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/TzJIL" rel="nofollow">@cjdelisle</a>), the <a href="https://archive.is/P37aF" rel="nofollow">lead developer of <strong>cjdns</strong></a> and <a href="https://archive.is/lvtgI#selection-1645.0-1645.19" rel="nofollow">project admin</a> for <a href="https://archive.is/Bgsjv#selection-303.1-321.1" rel="nofollow"><strong>XWiki</strong></a>, who told me that he <a href="https://archive.is/ZVKLz" rel="nofollow">does not support the message of that account</a> and has <a href="https://archive.is/qUtfY#selection-821.0-821.445" rel="nofollow">added a disclaimer</a> (as did I when it decided to <a href="https://archive.is/bccqo#selection-1031.1-1031.27" rel="nofollow">link here</a> instead, as the account violates my anti-harassment policy). On November 6th, the account changed to "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222061406/https:/twitter.com/jaketheraper" rel="nofollow">Ban Jake Scott</a>" after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917131950/https://twitter.com/JakeTheRaper" rel="nofollow">disappearing in September</a> and deleting all of their tweets on Appelbaum.</p>
<p dir="auto">On June 15th, a name-spoofed account (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523173443/https:/twitter.com/chaosupdales?lang=en" rel="nofollow">@chaosupdales</a>) tweeted that "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523173611/https:/twitter.com/chaosupdales/status/743197667157762048?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Jacob Appelbaum is barred from attending all CCC events</a>."

After the real CCC account announced that Appelbaum would not be welcome (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#chaos-computer-club"><em>Chaos Computer Club</em></a>'), it responded: "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523173944/https:/twitter.com/chaosupdales/status/743833333239537664?lang=en" rel="nofollow">It seems, dreams can be achieved.</a>" The next day they tweeted that they were "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170523174101/https:/twitter.com/chaosupdales/status/744127041834991616?lang=en" rel="nofollow">a wishful account</a>."</p>

<p dir="auto">On August 8th, another new <strong>Twitter</strong> account (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808143950/https:/twitter.com/WatsRllyGoingOn" rel="nofollow">@WatsRllyGoingOn</a>) began tweeting very explicit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix" rel="nofollow">dominatrix</a> GIFs to portray Appelbaum as a sex slave of various women involved in the allegations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810190102/https://twitter.com/WatsRllyGoingOn/status/763445807357972481" rel="nofollow">referencing</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160808213906/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/547778126525521920" rel="nofollow">#FemdomDarknet</a> hashtag in the <strong>Twitter</strong> profiles of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810190305/https://twitter.com/WatsRllyGoingOn/status/763437977766797312" rel="nofollow">Macrina</a> and Shepard.

<p dir="auto">Around June 25th, <a href="https://archive.is/40kys" rel="nofollow">@VictimsOfJake</a> tweeted a link to <a href="https://archive.is/OIK0V" rel="nofollow">an encrypted pastebin</a> on <a href="https://archive.is/Zf4Mp" rel="nofollow">0bin.net</a>,

 Among other allegations of complicated sexual relationships among

specifies that "criminal penalties for the intentional, unauthorized

 is correct and he worked with the CIA for a total of eight years (from 
2006 to 2014), then the leak would fall within that sensitive 5-year

 and no additional classified information about his work was revealed in

<p dir="auto">During CIA training in 2013, I was instructed that CIA 
officers are allowed to violate US law while conducting operations. I 
pushed back against this interpretation during class and was reprimanded
 for doing so. I have no reason to believe that that training has 
changed.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the Army, I received training on not just my right but 
my responsibility to disobey unlawful or immoral orders. No such 
training was part of the CIA's curriculum for [Directorate of 
Operations] officers during my tenure from 2006 to 2014. This is not 
part of the culture.</p>
<p dir="auto">All nations' intelligence agencies (and armies) break 
FOREIGN laws because espionage (and invasion) isn't legal. That's par 
for the course. But where soldiers have a rich tradition of moral 
philosophy, the CIA tends to respond with "we were just following 
orders." We hanged Nazis who used this defense. If the CIA is going to 
inculcate a tradition of respect for the rule of law, it's going to 
require a significant change in curriculum and some intelligence 
equivalent of courts martial empowered to actually enforce that law in 
the field.</p>

 even though he now claims to have been instructed to break both

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I was in a meeting with [Director of the National 
Clandestine Service] where he asserted, angrily, that he was going to 
put a stop to Chiefs of Station violating the law (re: things like 
casual petty cash theft) and being promoted on time. ("They can't just 
keep paying it back and saying it's fixed.") He wasn't so naive as to 
think that he could sanction these officers, he just wanted to keep 
casual lawbreakers from being promoted as fast as their peers.</p>

<p dir="auto">Though no specific allegation is made, there is also a general complaint about <a href="https://archive.is/5Aebu#selection-835.118-835.167" rel="nofollow">his name frequently being first on the list of authors</a> for academic papers; however <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314150541/http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf" rel="nofollow">the practice of listing authorship alphabetically in research</a>, especially within the U.S. and in the fields of math and computer science, is very common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">For this reason, mathematicians traditionally list authors
 on joint papers in alphabetical order. An analysis of journal articles 
with at least one U.S. based author shows that nearly half were jointly 
authored. Of these, more than 75% listed the authors in alphabetical 
order. In pure mathematics, nearly all joint papers (over 90%) list 
authors alphabetically.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">These traditions differ from other areas of scholarship, 
especially those that frequently involve large numbers of researchers 
working on a single research project. In areas of mathematics that are 
more closely associated to such areas, the culture and traditions may 
blend together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">While these traditions are well-known to mathematicians, 
they are often misunderstood by other scholars whose traditions differ. 
Occasionally, this works against young mathematicians — especially those
 with names near the end of the alphabet.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://archive.is/bFXW2" rel="nofollow">first</a> was <a href="https://archive.is/9kjWs" rel="nofollow">Nick Farr</a>, one of four individuals to eventually claim authorship of <a href="https://archive.is/vekwa" rel="nofollow">a story</a> on the "victims collective" website. His entry is now dated <a href="https://archive.is/qBIJV#selection-647.0-649.0" rel="nofollow">January 25th, 2016</a>. He alleges that he was verbally harassed during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160411055714/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow"><strong>Chaos Communication Congress</strong> event in 2013 (30c3)</a>, where he was an organizer of the Lightning Talks; Norton <a href="https://archive.is/thLMm" rel="nofollow">says</a>
 she witnessed it. After approving a proposal for a talk which was going
 to argue that Appelbaum was a U.S. intelligence operative, he was 
chastised first via email and then in person multiple times by both 
Appelbaum and "important people in the CCC."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-357.161-357.319" rel="nofollow">Jake
 demanded all the records I had received from this person. Jake also had
 the CCC edit the 30c3 wiki database to eliminate any trace of the 
offending talk.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Furthermore, he says <a href="https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-373.84-373.139" rel="nofollow">a note</a> was left every night on his hotel room pillow (though he does not know by whom):</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">"Don't make us use extreme measures. Hand it all over."</p>

<p dir="auto">During the conference, Farr had not tweeted that he felt 
threatened or intimidated.

On the 29th, he tweeted: "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160918173755/https://twitter.com/Nickf4rr/status/417421082283765760" rel="nofollow">Pro Tipp: Don't let bullies win. #30C3</a>," and did not respond to requests for elaboration. Two months later, he cryptically tweeted: "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160918183241/https:/twitter.com/Nickf4rr/status/430590809554292736" rel="nofollow">Note
 to self: Don't volunteer for any org where gratitude is not part of the
 culture. #saythankyounotfsckyouwhenyourvolunteersmoveon</a>." He did not specify what organisation he was referring to, only indicating in replies that the ingratitude came from "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160918183241/https:/twitter.com/Nickf4rr/status/430590809554292736" rel="nofollow">fellow organizers</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">In March 2014, Farr published "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106122225/http://www.nickfarr.org/2014/03/what-i-miss-most-about-the-30c3/" rel="nofollow">What I Miss Most About The 30c3</a>" on his now <a href="https://archive.is/SNpXv" rel="nofollow">defunct</a> personal site. He wrote about his favorite aspects of the "amazing" <strong>Chaos Communication Congress</strong> but concluded that he wasn't planning to attend further Congresses due to family needs (with no mention of Appelbaum).</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">While it’s not a huge surprise to many of you, I think I’m
 going to let the 30c3 be the highlight of my Congress experience and a 
great feeling I’m going to hold onto for a few years. I couldn’t imagine
 a better note to take a rest on. I’m also incredibly grateful to the 
team that’s taking over the Lightning Talks, I am sure they will take my
 work and build immensely on it. While you’re all enjoying the 
31/2/3c3s, I’ll hopefully be welcoming my own family into this wonderful
 world you’re all helping create.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The Social Engineering Department is devoted to the study 
of controlling large groups or societies through the use of coercion and
 through the subtle changing of social mores and belief over time. The

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Bringing people together is my life’s work. The text that 
was originally here is not an example of bringing people together, in

my life trying to nourish. I apologize for deepening those rifts and am 
working to help repair them.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are powerful forces that are using personally 
traumatic disputes to keep people bickering instead of focusing on 
building community, solidarity and the tools and techniques with which 
we can resist and restore our freedoms.</p>

<p dir="auto">On June 5th 2018, he tweeted a thread about his own misunderstandings about consent in relationships:</p>

<p dir="auto">When she met Appelbaum again in Berlin he insisted that he
 was the real victim because other people were making “false claims” 
about him. “He put on such a show on this little bench we were sitting 
on. It wasn’t that cold but he ostensibly shivered, asking repeatedly 
why I didn’t want to come over for tea.” Hoping for an apology was 
futile, she realised. “It was all about him trying to get me into his 
thrall with stylizing himself as the victim,” she says.</p>

<p dir="auto">In October 2011, Lovecruft published a blog post titled "<a href="https://archive.is/UMI64" rel="nofollow">Schizophrenia is a Chronological Disorder?</a>" in response to reading <a href="https://archive.is/MrYOU" rel="nofollow">a summary of talks</a> delivered at a recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110924090602/https://fqxi.org/conference/2011" rel="nofollow">physics and cosmology conference</a>. Neuroscientist <a href="https://archive.is/nFbhj" rel="nofollow">David Eagleman</a> had <a href="https://archive.is/qLwfp" rel="nofollow">proposed</a>
 that "the brains ability to maintain temporal order, or failure to do 
so, might be a possible root of schizophrenia." Lovecruft <a href="https://archive.is/L0d9x" rel="nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">As someone who is intensely interested in the theoretics 
of time travel, and also has been effected by schizophrenia (well, 
technically, my doctors are calling it schizoaffective disorder, which 
is undifferentiated schizophrenia and bipolar disorders coexisting 
simultaneously) for over a decade, I find this hypothesis of 
schizophrenia as a sort of neuro-chronological disorder oddly sensible 
and yet equally astounding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... Lastly, I would like to state that I feel at once both
 within a position of privilege and deprivation while speaking of these 
ideas. I recognise that I have better insights into the workings and 
structures of schizophrenia as one who endures living with it, yet I 
cannot help but doubt my ideas pertaining to its pathogenesis in light 
of the neurological systems of self-obfuscation and segmentation — the 
very things which I am trying to see and define. It’s tortuously 
frustrating.</p>

<p dir="auto">In December 2015, Kobeïssi had asked if "<a href="https://archive.is/20X7J" rel="nofollow">having delusions of persecution</a>" was "<a href="https://archive.is/20X7J" rel="nofollow">a prerequisite for getting hired at the Tor Project?

'Kit' met with Appelbaum on May 27th after he cancelled his talk at <strong>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven</strong> due to "sickness" (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-resignation"><em>The Resignation</em></a>') and confirmed that he "<a href="https://archive.is/rhiaC#selection-49.312-53.187" rel="nofollow">was looking horribly sick</a>."

<p dir="auto">Isis and John were having a discussion amongst themselves,
 so I strolled along behind them, preoccupied with my own thoughts. In 
the hotel, on the stairs to the rooms, I heard Isis saying that they 
want to see it (or him) burned totally to the ground. The “it” was too 
quiet for me to hear clearly, and might have been “him”. John answered 
that a small controlled burn should be sufficient enough to reach Isis’ 
goal on which Isis replied that they need assurance that it (or he) 
cannot rise again. Isis said that if an inferno is needed, an inferno 
needed to be used. At this point I had no clue what/who they were 
talking about. I did have a funny anecdote about fires from my past and 
told them this. After this I reached my floor and said goodnight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">On Saturday, the day after the last talks, Isis, John and a
 couple of others were sitting with me in the lobby of the hotel. I was 
asked to read, check and comment on a blog John was writing. At this 
moment, Isis had not yet told the world that the “Forest story” on the 
website was their story, but it was clear to me that Isis was at least 
one of the stories; I suspected Isis was “Forest”; John used “Forest” as
 an example, apparently confirming my suspicion. This has been confirmed
 by Isis themself on <a href="https://blog.patternsinthevoid.net/the-forest-for-the-trees.html" rel="nofollow">their blog</a> by now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">While I was helping John with his blog post, Isis was 
looking up German law. Isis was reading laws out loud that suggested 
they was trying to find out what kind of punishment there is for someone
 that doesn’t testify or isn’t fully truthful in their testimony or even
 committed perjury. Isis even asked John if he knew what would happen to
 a foreigner living on a visa committing perjury. I was shocked that 
Isis would even think about taking this kind of action in a court of 
law. Isis stated that they was planning on pretending to be one of the 
other, less grave stories, instead of testifying as Forest, if it came 
to a trial in Germany. Since John was using “Forest” as an example in 
his blog, Isis stated that they was convinced that the blog would lead 
back to Isis and they would be called in for questioning. If this 
happened, Isis would testify as one of the stories that did not include 
rape, since they didn’t want to tell the rape story over and over again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Isis also looked up what would happen to Jake if found 
guilty in a court of law. Isis found that he would be deported and would
 never be able to get a visa in any European country if he got convicted
 of a violent crime. Isis looked very smug and happy about this fact. 
John said that this implied facing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum#Surveillance.2C_airport_detention.2C_and_Wikileaks_investigation" rel="nofollow">(red. WikiLeaks) Grand Jury</a>
 in America for Jake and that he thought that this would be too grave. 
Isis said that they wanted Jake to leave all the countries they might

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Instead, I had planned to gather people for a secret 
meeting in Valencia, somewhere calm, neutral, and away from events, like
 on the beach, invite Jake, and have everyone willing who has ever been 
sexually assaulted, humiliated, harassed, or felt their boundaries 
disrespected, by him to take turns telling a few sentences about what he
 did to them and how it made them feel. Then we would tell Jake that, as
 his friends, we thought this needed to stop, and that we’d either 
deliver a list of the stories to The Tor Project and other 
organisations, or make all the stories public, if he refused to hold 
himself accountable for his actions or his behaviour did not appear to 
improve. In planning this secret meeting, I tried to determine what 
would cause Jake to perpetually disrespect other people like this, and 
if there were any positive things we could do to help him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">There are some differences between how Jake is behaving to
 how the other anarchist I mentioned above was behaving. The other

his victims’ needs, and eventually sincerely apologetic for his actions.</p>

<p dir="auto">The evening of Feb 3rd I talked with Jake for five hours. 
Jake was open to the idea of a group discussion, just not in Valencia, 
as the previous year he had been traumatized with false allegations. 
Jake also said he first needed to clarify if anyone was pressing legal 
charges presently- the intervention was only one topic we discussed- the
 other was that Jake had heard rumors of being called a rapist. Both of 
Jake[']s concerns made sense to me. It was an intense conversation, but a
 respectful one. I was trying to be a peaceful mediator. I believed in

am not a victim of Jake," she told Die Zeit. She says she told a friend 
about the intense kiss in confidence. This story was not merely used on

<p dir="auto">In that time we spent together, he violated boundaries I 
set as though they were a game, particularly at times when I was 
intoxicated. There were a number of times I felt afraid and violated 
during interactions with Jacob. Being involved with him was a steady 
stream of humiliations small and large as he mistreated me in front of 
others and over-shared about our intimate interactions with friends who 
were often also professional colleagues.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, on several occasions in professional 
situations, he told other people that I was good at a particular sex 
act. On another occasion where my primary romantic partner at the time, <a href="https://archive.is/yi79U" rel="nofollow">Paul Wouters</a>,
 was also present, Jacob ignored my use of a safeword when his sexual 
behavior turned into violent behavior that violated my limits. Paul and I
 both had to repeatedly tell Jacob to stop, and the experience was 
profoundly upsetting.</p>

<p dir="auto">On March 16th 2017, de Valence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317025508/https:/twitter.com/hdevalence/status/842526511915786240?lang=en" rel="nofollow">published</a> his <a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj" rel="nofollow">own account of events</a> relating to Appelbaum, Lovecruft (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#isis-lovecruft"><em>Isis Lovecruft</em></a>'), and various members of staff at <strong>Technische Universiteit Eindhoven</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">On August 31, 2015, I started a Ph.D. in cryptography at 
TU Eindhoven, working with Tanja Lange and Dan Bernstein. On December 2,
 2016, I resigned, due to sexual harassment, bullying, blackmail, and 
physical harm as a result of their favorite student, Jacob Appelbaum, as
 well as Tanja and Dan’s total abdication of their responsibility to 
manage the workplace environment in their research group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">He claimed to have "<a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-201.0-201.100" rel="nofollow">first heard of Jacob’s inappropriate behaviour in December of 2015, while in Berlin after the CCC</a>" when "<a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-201.101-201.384" rel="nofollow">a close friend contacted me, telling that Jacob had grabbed her</a>." During a trip to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612232443/https:/twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=from%3Aioerror%20Japan%20until%3A2016-02-28&amp;src=typd?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Fukuoka, Japan</a>, for <a href="https://archive.fo/HY3Ij" rel="nofollow">the <strong>Seventh International Conference on Post-Quantum Cryptography</strong> (PQCrypto) from February 24-26 2016</a>, he alleges that Appelbaum <a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-257.0-257.449" rel="nofollow">engaged him in sexually explicit conversations</a> and <a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-241.209-241.546" rel="nofollow">convinced him to put an irritant eye drop in his right eye</a>, which "<a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-241.547-241.781" rel="nofollow">has never really felt the same since then</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">He also felt that Lange and Bernstein gave Appelbaum special treatment and didn't require him "<a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-217.132-217.210" rel="nofollow">to complete the homework for his required courses on time</a>." According to emails from Bernstein (published by de Valence), "<a href="https://archive.fo/pT5aK#selection-9.53248-9.53784" rel="nofollow">a committee at TU/e charged by law with ensuring proper grading... formally investigated and rejected</a>" his claim of 'special treatment'. The latter situation was due to a pre-arranged "<a href="https://archive.fo/pT5aK#selection-9.261-9.442" rel="nofollow">50-50 split between Tor and TU/e</a>" (the <a href="https://archive.is/hPRWO" rel="nofollow">same option</a> given to Lovecruft at Radboud) over the course of five years, including a one-year extension to <a href="https://archive.fo/M7Lsc#selection-14523.0-14523.89" rel="nofollow">the university's standard <em>four-year</em> timespan of study</a> to make up for lost time. Bernstein repeatedly wrote he was "<a href="https://archive.fo/pT5aK#selection-9.54112-9.54452" rel="nofollow">puzzled</a>" why de Valence <a href="https://archive.fo/pT5aK#selection-9.21741-9.21926" rel="nofollow">never filed a written complaint</a> after <a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-269.50-277.81" rel="nofollow">first speaking to him at the end of April</a>, prior to <a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-381.112-409.325" rel="nofollow">contacting the Human Resources department in late August</a>. In contradiction to what is presented in the emails, de Valence <a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-365.0-373.282" rel="nofollow">argued that Bernstein had no actual interest in taking action</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">While <a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-425.223-429.325" rel="nofollow">waiting for a follow-up with Human Resources</a>, de Valence said he traveled to Belgium for a project meeting and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317195155/https:/twitter.com/UWCrySP/status/786252117988216834?lang=en" rel="nofollow">gave a talk for the CrySP research group</a> at the <a href="https://archive.fo/RpQE2#selection-145.1-153.43" rel="nofollow"><strong>University of Waterloo</strong> in Canada</a> on October 14th (the day after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317195041/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/788071809799323648" rel="nofollow">Lovecruft's</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/RpQE2#selection-133.1-141.41" rel="nofollow">talk</a>). According to Bernstein, de Valence <a href="https://archive.fo/pT5aK#selection-9.22940-9.24416" rel="nofollow">hadn't finished his portion of the work for a team research project prior to the submission deadline</a> and then <a href="https://archive.fo/pT5aK#selection-9.24418-9.25391" rel="nofollow">presented the paper at Waterloo without permission from the rest of the team</a>; de Valence responded that this story was "<a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-457.115-461.129" rel="nofollow">long, irrelevant, and inaccurate</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.fo/oJBIj#selection-437.0-441.93" rel="nofollow">I
 informed HR that I was having panic attacks about my workplace and 
would be working on other research projects from home while they dealt 
with the situation. I would later learn that HR reported to Tanja that I
 was “ill” at this time. In mid-November, HR informed me that I needed 
to undergo a mandatory mental health evaluation with the “company 
doctor”. I found it deeply offensive to demand this after their failure 
to act on my complaint, and declined. I wrote a resignation letter 
addressed to the dean at the end of November, and sent it to HR.</a></p>

movie and lying on the couch, and while they were, she had supposedly

 able to speak with three of the five guests who were present. One

happened after that. No person there on that evening says they watched 
Mr. Appelbaum and River having sex. One of those present only remembers 
that somebody murmured "Can I join in?" when River and Mr. Appelbaum

after the excesses of New Year’s Eve. At most a joint. Not one of the 
total of eight witnesses present during those three nights and two days 
in January remember River ever being unconscious. Also, no one says they

She claimed to have "<a href="https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.107-333.217" rel="nofollow">heard multiple stories from employees who had been sexually harassed and/or manipulated by Jake over the years</a>," but "<a href="https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.226-333.262" rel="nofollow">never anything as serious as assault</a>." She previously "<a href="https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.354-333.722" rel="nofollow">didn't really buy</a>" that there would have been backlash from Appelbaum had anyone spoken up, and he "<a href="https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-335.2-335.68" rel="nofollow">is/was a close and longtime friend of many of my ex-partners</a>."</p>

 left with the uncomfortable, dissonant realization that I am friends

than I think is safe for any community.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">She also gives detail on <a href="https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-343.353-343.1108" rel="nofollow">a personal story</a> which may establish her as a possible witness to the story of <a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#chelsea-komlo">Komlo</a> (aka "River"), though she did not mention anyone by name and has not done so since. After getting drunk at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813230050/https:/twitter.com/bcrypt/status/682908552969752576" rel="nofollow">Berlin party</a> following the <strong>Chaos Communication Congress</strong>, she awoke in Appelbaum's bed, "<a href="https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-343.512-343.564" rel="nofollow">feeling sick with no clear memory of how I got there</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I pulled myself out of the bed, stumbled into the dark 
living room, and found someone I knew. I asked them whose bed I was in, 
and they said Jake’s. I felt gross upon hearing that, but as far as I 
could tell, nothing bad had happened and I had a friend at the party who
 was looking out for me. Still, I was disturbed by the thought of being 
unconscious in his room at a party with a bunch of strangers and a 
3-hour hole in my memory. I vowed not to drink that much alcohol ever 
again, and indeed I’ve barely drank at all in the last 6 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If people had spoken up earlier about Jake being a serial 
rapist, I wouldn’t have let down my guard and followed my friends to 
Jake’s apartment in an intoxicated state, regardless of whether he had 
been proven guilty in court or not. It’s just not a risk I could afford.</p>

<p dir="auto">Based on a <strong>Twitter</strong> exchange with someone who "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813225931/https:/twitter.com/draednaut/status/683031325872381952" rel="nofollow">ran into you on the street and I wished you luck at orgyleaks</a>," this was most likely the night of Appelbaum's New Year's Eve party.

Regarding the plagiarism allegations, she claimed "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016024910/https:/twitter.com/violetblue/status/740447810009628672" rel="nofollow">all his work is a sham</a>," but like Patterson and Norton did not specify any details. She added that these experiences made her wary of "<a href="https://archive.is/k3vJE#selection-6669.17-6669.53" rel="nofollow">hero worship in 'hacktivism' circles'</a>." On June 16th 2016, Blue <a href="https://archive.is/rEJoc" rel="nofollow">published</a> a <a href="https://archive.is/XSMJy" rel="nofollow">Medium post</a> with more detail about her allegations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Blue had first properly met Appelbaum in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210520155937/https://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/46115082/" rel="nofollow">September</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210520155138/https://www.flickr.com/photos/dork/46283284/" rel="nofollow">2005</a> around the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051031210322/http://www.webzine2005.com/" rel="nofollow">Webzine event</a> in San Francisco, where he gave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051211053917/http://www.webzine2005.com/archive/webzine2005.0924.jacob_appelbaum.mp3" rel="nofollow">a talk</a> about his father's death, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060316023130/http://jacob.wordpress.com/2005/09/24/the-internet-archive-and-webzine2005/" rel="nofollow">working as a journalist in Iraq and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina</a>. She <a href="https://archive.is/pne99" rel="nofollow">wrote</a>
 that she felt "an instant connection to something inside of me" and 
"was so glad I came to be a part of something so much greater than 
another masturbatory tech conference."</p>
<p dir="auto">In March 2007, she attended one of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210520163823/https://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/albums/72157600005086739" rel="nofollow">happy-hour</a> tours at <strong>Kink.com</strong>'s '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070321000630/https://laughingsquid.com/kinkcom-happy-hour-at-the-porn-palace/" rel="nofollow">Porn Palace</a>' with writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140810032322/http://evebatey.com/about/" rel="nofollow">Eve Batey</a>, <strong>Laughing Squid</strong>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070306002602/http://hrlori.com/lori-dorn/" rel="nofollow">Lori Dorn</a> and photographer <a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master">Scott Beale

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I was standing with my Chronicle editor, Eve Batey, when 
Jake told the group he fucked the models, and that he’d ejaculate under 
or around the desk of someone he didn’t like. He joked, “Don’t drop your
 muffin, buddy!” And that’s when Eve and I bailed out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">At a different happy-hour, Blue also claimed Appelbaum publicly humiliated her in front of his friends by saying she "<a href="https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-451.225-451.275" rel="nofollow">gives great head</a>." She responded that he had confused her "<a href="https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-451.506-451.567" rel="nofollow">with a certain blond blogger</a>," which may have been a reference to Xeni Jardin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Outside of Kink, in 2007, Jake had sexually targeted a 
female friend of mine. Her and I were going to a large tech party in 
December; I think it was a Wikimedia party, and Jimmy Wales was there. 
My friend was feeling hunted by Jake, and early in the party she said he
 was trying to isolate her, and told me she was scared. She is not a big
 or strong girl, nor is she loud, and he was trying to convince her to 
go into a stairwell with him. The convincing turned into trying to pull 
her away physically, grabbing at her hands. I locked my arm with hers, 
and put myself in between her and Jake. All while he was trying to reach
 around me, while he was telling me to let go. I said No, she’s not 
going with you. I insisted a bit louder, <em>No</em>. He was livid.</p>

<p dir="auto">In April 2008, Waldman indicated that she <a href="https://archive.is/tL8lQ" rel="nofollow">wanted Appelbaum to follow her back</a> on Twitter, and on another occasion was <a href="https://archive.ph/9NjRW" rel="nofollow">happy when he joined her for lunch</a>. In May, she tweeted about watching "<a href="https://archive.ph/VkxvR" rel="nofollow">videos that @ioerror sends me late at night</a>." In December 2009, he encouraged her <a href="https://archive.ph/mrJNT" rel="nofollow">to</a> <a href="https://archive.ph/0GkmX" rel="nofollow">attend</a> <a href="https://archive.is/trDOo" rel="nofollow">26c3</a>. Blue also continued to positively reference <a href="https://archive.is/kBgmO#selection-291.112-291.121" rel="nofollow">Appelbaum</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/32Loj#selection-439.2-443.1" rel="nofollow">his work</a> in her blogs, including <a href="https://archive.is/qof5T#selection-399.2-399.6" rel="nofollow">a thank-you birthday post</a> in September 2009. Yet she alleges that he "<a href="https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-511.145-511.185" rel="nofollow">stood over me, glaring down into my eyes</a>" during an engagement party in the same year.</p>
<p dir="auto">In June 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061747/http://www.tinynibbles.com/blogarchives/2008/06/digital-notes-and-errata.html" rel="nofollow">Blue</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160920235145/https://www.tinynibbles.com/blogarchives/2008/06/when-transparency-does-not-equal-erased.html" rel="nofollow">noticed</a> that about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090227163739/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/07/regarding-boing.html" rel="nofollow">seventy two</a> <strong>Boing Boing</strong> posts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701164050/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/06/violet-blue-scr.html" rel="nofollow">mentioning or linking to her work</a> had been "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080702132701/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/01/that-violet-blue-thi.html" rel="nofollow">unpublished</a>" from the blog's archives "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080728211729/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/18/lessons-learned.html" rel="nofollow">for personal reasons</a>," which <a href="https://archive.is/GILb#selection-669.0-673.311" rel="nofollow">Jardin chose not to elaborate on</a>. Blue later called her a "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160920224103/https:/twitter.com/violetblue/status/488478917359980544" rel="nofollow">douche</a>." Appelbaum would remain on <a href="https://archive.is/rqd0S" rel="nofollow">friendly</a> / <a href="https://archive.is/7zTkB" rel="nofollow">speaking terms</a> with Jardin at least until April 2016.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then in February 2013, Blue overheard and laughed at someone saying, "<a href="https://archive.is/mvgJ5" rel="nofollow">I didn't know how many other douchebags used to work there. I thought it was just Jake</a>." Batey and Wolf liked the tweet. Later the same month, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325113826/http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage" rel="nofollow"><strong>BSides San Francisco</strong></a> conference announced that Blue's talk, "<a href="https://archive.is/0UHK2#selection-2145.0-2145.39" rel="nofollow">Sex +/- Drugs: Known Vulns and Exploits</a>," had been pulled from the event because it "<a href="https://archive.is/4a4WA" rel="nofollow">was inappropriate and possibly alienating to women</a>" according <a href="https://archive.is/8oUnH" rel="nofollow">to</a> <a href="https://archive.is/CvBUb" rel="nofollow">complaints</a> from Aurora and the <strong>Ada Initiative</strong>. The organisers later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041114/http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/35868077/BSidesSanFrancisco" rel="nofollow">clarified</a> that they did not necessarily agree. Blue, in her own response, countered that "<a href="https://archive.is/SeUp9" rel="nofollow">these
 women have effectively used the subjects of rape and sexual harassment 
to make anyone who would question them feel uncomfortable</a>." Patterson commented, "<a href="https://archive.is/OwOek" rel="nofollow">Apparently we're fragile flowers who can't handle real talk about drugs and sex</a>." Appelbaum voiced his <a href="https://archive.is/OeqHP" rel="nofollow">confusion</a> and disagreement with the decision, and the broader opinion that <a href="https://archive.is/ZguXt" rel="nofollow">talks on sex don't belong at data security conferences</a>. "<a href="https://archive.is/4EgAc" rel="nofollow">A
 warning about content is reasonable for these kinds of topics. Still, 
it is a matter of taste... blanket censorship of Violet isn't tolerance</a>." (In the previous year, he had <a href="https://archive.is/vfEb4" rel="nofollow">shared</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/6Ddkj" rel="nofollow">amplified the donation page of the <strong>Ada Initiative</strong></a>; they also asked him for "<a href="https://archive.is/3FtyX" rel="nofollow">suggestions on our sex / porn exception to the conference anti-harassment policy</a>," referring to a recent post on "<a href="https://archive.is/XxZiq" rel="nofollow">making conferences more women-friendly</a>.")</p>
<p dir="auto">In October 2013, Blue <a href="https://archive.is/4EgAc" rel="nofollow">agreed</a> with a statement claiming Jardin had "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160920224239/https:/twitter.com/violetblue/status/386609394462384128" rel="nofollow">an active and deceitful role</a>" in building Appelbaum's fame, but <a href="https://archive.fo/3wQob" rel="nofollow">denied</a> she had been sexually involved with either of them. While <a href="https://archive.is/buXXx" rel="nofollow">attending</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140304040104/https://incontext2014.com/" rel="nofollow">InContext conference</a> in February 2014, Blue tweeted:</p>

<p dir="auto">In her 2016 Medium post, Blue <a href="https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-363.2-367.2" rel="nofollow">misidentified Shepard as "Tor Project's director"</a> even though the <strong>WIRED</strong> interview she links to <a href="https://archive.is/FsG0A#selection-1541.163-1541.659" rel="nofollow">clearly says Shepard is a core developer</a>. Furthermore, she falsely conflated two separate events in her summarization of the timeline of events surrounding <a href="https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-555.0-563.59" rel="nofollow">the Valencia intervention</a>; the incident with Reilly at the Tor dinner was at the beginning of <a href="https://archive.is/DrGwH" rel="nofollow">March 2015</a>, whereas Lovecruft said they began planning their intervention <a href="https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-185.0-185.68" rel="nofollow">in early 2016</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In February 2018, she implied that Appelbaum "<a href="https://archive.is/D19Ec#selection-739.0-747.11" rel="nofollow">exploits queerness to cover his tracks</a>."</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/Ulttg#selection-2102.0-2191.22" rel="nofollow">Emerson Tan</a>, a <a href="https://archive.is/TEIUh" rel="nofollow">London-based security professional</a>, told both <a href="https://archive.is/K2tdt" rel="nofollow"><strong>Gizmodo</strong></a> and <a href="https://archive.is/QZIdh" rel="nofollow"><strong>The Daily Dot</strong></a> about an incident he claimed to have witnessed in the middle of the night on "<a href="https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1047.91-1047.123" rel="nofollow">the day we arrived at CCC"</a> during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160607230238/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Static:Main_Page" rel="nofollow">2015 <strong>Chaos Communication Congress</strong></a> in Hamburg, Germany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">"At about 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning I happen to be 
talking to [Patterson], [Shepard] and Jacob Appelbaum and a group of 
other people who have come out of the congress hall into the lobby of 
the Raddison Blu hotel in Hamburg,” Tan told Gizmodo. “Jake has his 
hands all over this girl, and she is very obviously not very happy. You 
know, she’s looking for her bag, they’re having a conversation and she’s
 looking for her bag she can’t find her bag and she appears to be really
 quite distressed and Appelbaum forcibly attempts to try and kiss her, 
grabs her arm and her backside and makes a move for her breasts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">... And the other males who we were with were basically 
just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see 
anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing,” Tan said. 
“So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to 
go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. 
Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job 
he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the 
girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in 
an undistracted fashion. She left, and I found her hiding out in the 
hotel bar later, after Jake had left. She was pretty composed but 
obviously upset."</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In <strong>The Daily Dot</strong> interview he gave a more detailed account, including what the girl, who Patterson claimed was "<a href="https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1059.80-1059.113" rel="nofollow">obviously a little bit inebriated</a>," did <a href="https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1087.0-1087.256" rel="nofollow">after the incident</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Tan said afterwards he spoke briefly with the woman. He 
asked if she wanted to file a police report, but she was unwilling. She 
left the hotel before any of the witnesses learned who she was. The 
incident was never reported to police or to the Tor Project.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731220858/https://twitter.com/thequux" rel="nofollow">Dan Hirsch</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/thequux" rel="nofollow">@thequux</a>), who had <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinguino/sets/72157667188334564" rel="nofollow">married Patterson</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731222612/https://twitter.com/pukingmonkey/status/741824783675883521" rel="nofollow">June 11th</a>, was also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731182508/http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/jacob-appelbaum-tor-project-suspension-sexual-misconduct-victims/" rel="nofollow">witness</a> but was not named in the <strong>Gizmodo</strong> interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">“Most of Jake’s attention was focused on some girl who was
 somewhat shorter than he was,” Hirsch said. “She was cornered against 
the bar, looking around I presumed to try to find an escape route or for
 someone she could get the attention of.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Tan posted the story on his Facebook page, saying that 
even though he didn't know who the girl was, he had submitted it to 
Steele as part of the investigation. He also mentioned seeing Appelbaum "<a href="https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1379.28-1379.233" rel="nofollow">trying
 to take upskirt photos of women" and "making lewd comments and 
allegations of threesomes with various members of the privacy community</a>." Shepard added that once when Appelbaum was "good drunk" in a Berlin bar in July of 2013, he "<a href="https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1385.127-1385.162" rel="nofollow">discussed how he would ‘use my ass’</a>."</p>

<p dir="auto">However, Tan's story has since been contested. On June 9th, the first alternative story released by <a href="https://archive.is/cFDr1" rel="nofollow">@Ioerror_info</a> using <a href="https://archive.is/UX9Jk" rel="nofollow"><strong>TwitLonger</strong></a>
 claimed that Tan's interpretation of the incident, which occurred on 
the night of December 26th, was wrong. The "girl," a woman named <a href="https://archive.is/nZJGj" rel="nofollow">Jill Bähring</a>, had not been subjected to unwanted sexual advances by Appelbaum, and in fact has been "<a href="https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-445.1-445.96" rel="nofollow">romantically involved</a>" with him (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#visit-to-cuba"><em>Visit to Cuba</em></a>'). Her account was <a href="https://archive.is/syKKA" rel="nofollow">initially private</a> but she made it public within a few hours of the statement being published to <a href="https://archive.is/nZJGj#selection-3499.0-3499.110" rel="nofollow">authenticate that it was from her</a>. She admitted to having temporarily lost her bag and being "<a href="https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-457.41-457.63" rel="nofollow">emotionally distressed</a>" at the time, but it was not because of Appelbaum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I did indeed look not very happy. I was emotionally 
distressed at that time and told Jake, one of my close confidants, about
 my situation. He did have his hands all over me, just as I had my hands
 all over him. At no point did Jake forcibly attempt to try and kiss me,
 nor did he grab me in any inappropriate manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">While we were talking, I realized that I didn’t have my 
bag with me, and started looking for it. Anyone who has ever lost sight 
of their wallet and phone will look “quite distressed” as a consequence.
 According to Tan and Patterson, none of our friends seemed to see 
anything wrong with that situation: “And the other males who we were 
with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t 
really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite 
distressing”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This is true. There was nothing wrong with it. I was among several friends with whom I felt absolutely safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">She also said that Tan's account of how he approached them wasn't accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The next day, I wasn’t going to be at the conference, so I
 didn’t expect to see Jake for a couple of weeks. Jake and I said 
goodbye to each other in the hotel lobby, and we kissed. But since my 
friend was waiting for me to leave, I playfully pushed Jake away. At 
that time, I noticed Emerson Tan for the first time – since he was 
intervening at that point. He states: “So I watched this for about two 
to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount
 a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s 
hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the
 rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to 
find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I recall Tan approaching me, asking me if Jacob was 
harassing me. I said he wasn't. Nevertheless, Tan dragged me away and 
immediately started talking intensely to Jake. At that point I decided 
to leave, since my friend was waiting for me. I walked him to his hotel,
 which was only a couple of blocks away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">She ended the statement by asking why "<a href="https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-509.1-521.68" rel="nofollow">a highly distorted version of my experience</a>" had been published in the first place. Le Heux <a href="https://archive.is/9VklJ#selection-1921.0-1921.95" rel="nofollow">retweeted the statement</a>
 saying "I was at Raddison Blu that night, I know these people &amp; as 
far as I know this story is accurate." In response to Isaacson arguing 
that third-party voices were damaging "in the current plublic climate," 
Le Heux said he (as well as Bähring) "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016024631/https:/twitter.com/LeHoax/status/741032635460386816" rel="nofollow">should
 be allowed to speak my truth about events where I was present, although
 I am a bit scared to do so in the current 'safe space'</a>." Zhu tweeted that she "<a href="https://archive.is/1ZMM7" rel="nofollow">was also around that night and didn't do anything because Jill seemed ok. Glad to hear that she was</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Gizmodo</strong> subsequently <a href="https://archive.is/dPAfG" rel="nofollow">published a new story</a> with Bähring's account, though they have yet to add an update to <a href="https://archive.is/toIZA" rel="nofollow">the original</a> despite at least <a href="https://archive.is/mxiMI" rel="nofollow">one request</a> to do so; <strong>The Daily Dot</strong> both <a href="https://archive.is/VBMmD#selection-1201.195-1213.57" rel="nofollow">added an update to their original story</a> and published <a href="https://archive.is/Qdima" rel="nofollow">a new one</a> (though they have yet to correct the statement about <a href="https://archive.is/vHxH2#selection-1255.0-1257.41" rel="nofollow">Bähring's story being published by Appelbaum</a>). Dell Cameron, one of three authors collaborating on coverage at <strong>The Daily Dot</strong>, tweeted <a href="https://archive.is/HATig#selection-5799.1-5799.18" rel="nofollow">screenshots of emails</a>
 to show he was trying to contact Bähring through Tomassini, as she has 
so far not spoken directly to the press. Tan was also contacted to <a href="https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-987.0-987.146" rel="nofollow">comment</a> on the fact that his story had been refuted and <a href="https://archive.is/wozbD#selection-7027.0-7027.42" rel="nofollow">denied approaching her to ask if she was being harassed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">“This is a situation open to misinterpretation because I 
do not know what she's thinking,” Tan said. “I'm fully willing to stand 
up and say that.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Macrina described the <strong>Gizmodo</strong> and <strong>Daily Dot</strong> articles as "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801154451/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/741074046536851456" rel="nofollow">one misreported story</a>."
 Neither Patterson nor Shepard revoked their statements. They both 
initially made brief comments on the fact that Bähring refuted their 
version of events. Replying to someone pointing out that she had yet to 
make any retraction, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731202718/https:/twitter.com/maradydd/status/744633281073778688" rel="nofollow">Patterson</a> said that "<a href="https://archive.is/oioum#selection-6789.1-6789.108" rel="nofollow">there are some goddamn impatient people on the internet. Response forthcoming, but I have a life and a job</a>." Shepard characterized the story as "<a href="https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-5705.79-5705.114" rel="nofollow">a minor incident the press inflated</a>" and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160731200225/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/744618405030989826" rel="nofollow">said she was not a reliable judge</a> of the situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-6053.1-6053.133" rel="nofollow">Frankly,
 I can't read neurotypical human interactions well enough to reliably

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Bähring avers that her interactions with Appelbaum were 
entirely consensual, which I am relieved and pleased to hear. I’m not 
sure why anyone would expect any other reaction out of me, seeing as how
 I’ve sung the praises of making mistakes and owning them in public for 
so long that I’ve <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1563/fail-faster-fail-better" rel="nofollow">given invited talks on it</a>.
 The interaction I observed took place within my line of sight but out 
of my earshot, and if I misinterpreted it, then I genuinely am sorry 
about that. Ultimately, Bähring makes her own decisions about what she 
consents to or doesn’t. If I was mistaken, well, good.</p>

<p dir="auto">In October 2017, while exposing Robert Scoble, Norton wrote about <a href="https://archive.fo/VfdXS#selection-297.0-305.495" rel="nofollow">restorative justice</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The demonization of either rapists or victims is what 
makes the subject unapproachable, and doesn’t let anyone intercede to 
get abusive people the help they need, much less the victims. Men aren’t
 wild predators, but sometimes the broken ones can do very bad things. 
Sometimes, even if rarely, broken women do bad things to men. So the 
people who care for, love, or need these broken people cover for them. 
They destroy the people that seem the most likely to destroy their loved
 ones: the victims. Ultimately, this neglect destroys their loved ones, 
too.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve watched this toxic dynamic play out in my life and 
others since I was a child. This is the first reason I became a fan of 
restorative justice. Not because I am some kind of soft-on-crime 
libtard, but because I’d rather less people got assaulted and raped in 
the future, and restorative justice prevents more terrible things from 
happening. But restorative justice is hard, for everyone, not just the 
aggressor and victim. It requires admitting and discussing painful 
issues, and looking for ways to make things whole, by the community, not
 just the people directly involved. This has to happen even when things 
can never be whole again.</p>

done something terrible.</a></p>

<p dir="auto">She claimed her pacifism justified continuing a "friendship" with Auernheimer (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#online-harassment-of-the-tor-project"><em>Online Harassment of the Tor Project</em></a>').</p>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">On September 25th, Norton referred to Appelbaum as a "<a href="https://archive.is/MfvP7" rel="nofollow">serial rapist and abuser</a>,"
 in asserting that 'be excellent to each other' should no longer be 
used. On October 21st, Shepard and Norton had a conversation about the "<a href="https://archive.is/u6o86" rel="nofollow">age</a>" at which <a href="https://archive.is/blDcv" rel="nofollow">fascists could be shot</a>, which may have contributed to the former's suspension from <strong>Twitter</strong>. On March 16th 2019, Norton claimed that "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190506110158/https:/twitter.com/quinnnorton/status/1106933527596224513?lang=en" rel="nofollow">people ignored his rampant plagiarism</a>," again without giving any examples.</p>
<p dir="auto">In September 2021, in response to <a href="https://archive.ph/ISh2N" rel="nofollow">York's speculation about a documentary</a>, Patterson said regarding its producers: "<a href="https://archive.ph/dIVvC" rel="nofollow">Yeah
 I want to find these people, blow up their phones, and make fun of them
 all over the internet for being the kinds of venal, greedy smoothbrains
 who would try to venerate such a pathetic douchebag. If this is what 
they want to do with their lives, I see no reason why they should sleep 
peacefully at night. They wanna fuck around? They can find out</a>." She asserted that Appelbaum "<a href="https://archive.ph/Sge82" rel="nofollow">got
 himself installed into a PhD program he isn't competent to complete, 
thanks to Roger Dingledine, @hyperelliptic, and @hashbreaker (who is 
still a coward, and no I'm still not going to apologise for having 
called you that, you pathetic loser)</a>." Further, she claimed that he had once avoided her at a train station and this "<a href="https://archive.ph/fWJkD" rel="nofollow">cracks me up every time I think about it</a>." In a separate conversation in October, Patterson once again alleged that "<a href="https://archive.ph/hHrbi" rel="nofollow">everything he was known for was actually someone else's work</a>," without any examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Prediction: exactly zero of Jake's fanboys will come after

In November 2019, he stated, "<a href="https://archive.is/KBIMU" rel="nofollow">I would pay my entire fortune to see Appelbaum, Assange, and Giuliani disappear from public memory</a>."

<p dir="auto">Is it really so hard to recognize both of these directions

 If I prejudge and punish accusers who have not had their day in court,

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">When I say "day in court", what I really mean is <strong>due process</strong>.
 Due process is a set of ethical principles that civilization has 
painstakingly developed over several centuries, recognizing that 
punishment is corrupted by many sources of error on both sides: 
communication is poor; memories are faulty; sometimes people don't tell 
the whole truth; sometimes people tell something other than the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">...  It's really not that hard to stay calm and say 
something like this: "We weren't there. At this point we can't be sure 
what happened. Sometimes accusations are true, and sometimes they 
aren't. It's important for a neutral judge to hear testimony from the 
accuser and from the accused."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">But not everyone stays calm. Angry people continue to join
 these mobs. They blog and tweet and report their ill-informed 
speculations in favor of the accuser or the accused, confident in their 
own righteousness and blithely unaware of the possibility of being 
wrong. Ultimately the accused and the accuser are both punished, truth 
be damned.</p>

to grow and make things better, not destroy the movement and create divisions. We need to create a channel for
discussions on how to make things better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-359.0-359.899" rel="nofollow">Given
 the volume of false characterizations of Jake floating around amidst 
the smears, I hope he will not mind me saying… These characterizations 
of him as a “rockstar,” as “aggressive,” as “selfish” — I don’t see how 
one could know Jake much at all while choosing these as their go-to 
descriptions of him, barring bad faith. Perhaps that we come from 
similar backgrounds has offered me some insight, but whenever I read 
these stories going around describing his personality, I’ve been unable 
to recognize him in them. While the those traits, when they do come out,
 might seem abrasive, when taken in context, the picture is very 
different. What I do recognize in them, however, is the characterization
 of him I long ago disputed with Alison, as I again had to push back 
against this recently, when she DM’d me again to tell me she could not 
believe I was defending Jake after he had “abandoned” me.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-363.0-363.632" rel="nofollow">There
 have certainly been occasions during which he and I have butted heads, 
but one thing that struck me about our interaction versus that of others
 with him, is that if I felt he was over-assertive in some regard, I 
would push back. Perhaps this is because I was not trying to win his 
favor, but rather that I appreciate him and his personality, and respect
 his ideas, experiences, and values. Part of being a friend is arguing 
and contradicting someone when you believe they are wrong, and likewise 
part of being a friend is letting someone know they’re being difficult 
even while going out of your way to maximize their comfort.</a></p>

<p dir="auto">On June 29th, in an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630124022/https:/twitter.com/guardian/status/880713911649128448?lang=en" rel="nofollow"><strong>Guardian</strong></a> feature writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630124122/https:/twitter.com/shattenstone?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Simon Hattenstone</a>, Poitras said she "<a href="https://archive.is/KIYkv#selection-3875.0-3879.334" rel="nofollow">knew I was being followed by intelligence agencies</a>" after making <em>Citizenfour</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">On January 14th 2021, Poitras published <a href="https://archive.is/yr9Fj" rel="nofollow">an open letter</a>
 sharing that she had been "fired from First Look Media, an organization
 I co-founded." She claims this was done in retaliation for recent 
comments to the <a href="https://archive.is/Ot7tS" rel="nofollow"><strong>New York Times</strong></a> that the organisation had engaged in "a cover-up and betrayal of core values" regarding Reality Winner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">CEO Michael Bloom and Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed have 
demonstrated repeatedly that they consider the whistleblowers and 
journalists who risk their lives on behalf of the organization as 
disposable. They demonstrated this by their lack of effort to protect 
Reality Winner. And again when they didn’t bother to inform Edward 
Snowden of their decision to defund the NSA archive. And now by firing 
me on a day’s notice from an organization built upon my work and 
reputation without even informing the staff or the public of their 
decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Snowden <a href="https://archive.is/rFntX" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a>
 that he believed her allegations and "of all the journalists I worked 
with to break the mass surveillance story, none of them took operational
 security or source protection as seriously as Laura."</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>First Look Media</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/ACM36" rel="nofollow">responded</a>
 that they "did not renew Laura Poitras’s independent contractor 
agreement because, despite our financial arrangement, she has not been 
active in any capacity with our company for more than two years." In <a href="https://archive.is/mUCZc" rel="nofollow">a co-authored article</a> from November 2014, exactly six years prior to her termination and about nine months into <a href="https://archive.is/SOkR5" rel="nofollow"><strong>The Intercept</strong>'s launch</a>,
 it was noted that "Greenwald, Poitras, and Scahill all opted to be 
independent contractors rather than First Look employees in order to 
maximize their freedom to speak out and act."</p>
<p dir="auto">On March 23rd, Poitras updated the open letter with audio clips and stated "<a href="https://archive.is/S7jVW" rel="nofollow">I
 continue to maintain, as I have done from the start, that my firing was
 the culmination of the company’s retaliation against me</a>."</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm going to say something that might be unpopular, but 
I'm going to do it anyway. I'm not so pleased with the way SHA has 
handled the Jacob Appelbaum story. I find it a little bit too easy to 
spread rumors without any factual evidence, and ban somebody completely 
from a community. I find that when these accusations take place, of 
sexual misconduct, it's a very serious conversation that needs to take 
place, but it shouldn't be one-sided. You shouldn't be able to point a 
finger at somebody and say, 'I don't like the way this person is 
behaving,' and then have them completely excluded from a community that 
they have contributed a lot to. I don't think this is the right way to 
move forward, because tomorrow it could be any one of us. So I'd really 
like to ask the SHA commission to re-examine and re-evaluate on their 
decisions in that part of community-building and trust.</p>

<p dir="auto">Dropping the 'A-baum.' Some of us have heard that Jacob 
Appelbaum has been called out as an abuser, not nice person. I was 
heavily influenced by his excitement for crypto work. He has contributed
 a ton. I'm sure people here have loved the work he's done. But also, 
he's not treated women and other people very nice. When I heard about 
this last month or so, I was really shocked, hurt, confused, and just 
angry that it went on for years apparently. Someone I know personally 
was affected by him. Right now this is a call-out to everyone here at 
HOPE, to say: we need more intentionally radical, safer spaces that take
 a solid stance against oppression of any kind. We need to call out the 
abusers so that other people like me... I've met him, I've been with him
 in situations in Berlin. I could have been one of those people. If I 
knew about that beforehand, I could have been safer. That's why it is 
important to make it public. I appreciate the work he's done, but, 
like... rapist. I don't want to be that guy's friend. He says he's an 
anarchist; that's not anarchy, that's oppression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The work we do is most dangerous when it attracts people 
who are inclined to abuse power and trust; to abuse those who are 
marginalized, sex and sexiness. In the past few years, we have learned 
over and over that hacking and tech have attracted just such abusers. 
Here in the hacker community, Captain Crunch, Jacob Appelbaum (who 
keynoted here at HOPE), Julian Assange, Morgan Marquis-Boire; in the 
Perl community, Michael Schwern; in the tech freedom community, Ali 
Bangi. They use their knowledge of technology to gain advantage over 
others and wield personal power over them.</p>
<p dir="auto">... When we act like security is unknowably hard and only 
to be handled by insiders, we prepare the groundwork -- each of us -- 
for newcomers to be groomed and preyed upon by charlatans and abusers. 
We build missing stairs. We were reminded of our dependence on experts 
when it became clear that it was dangerous to have let Jake, Morgan, and
 Ali into our spaces, because they were physically and sexually abusing 
people.</p>
<p dir="auto">... I expected to get the 'hasn't Jacob Appelbaum been set
 up' [question]. If you have hung out with Jacob Appelbaum for any 
period of time, it is completely clear that he did the things he did. 
Like I said, he is constantly violating people's boundaries in ways that
 are really freaky.</p>

<p dir="auto">I like Jake Appelbaum, but fuck Appelbaum-ists, really! 
He's a good friend of mine. I mean, he was so big when I first met him. 
Nice guy, yeah? But no, no, no. There is something weird going on in our
 brains if too many people are running after a person and saying, 'Jake,
 you're so great.' Jake is not Christ, but some people think that he's 
Christ. They're almost praying to him, and that's where the whole 
martyrdom comes in. Martyrdom is something that people really like, they
 like to be the martyrs, they like to have the feeling. It is kind of 
like an exchange, a strange economy. 'I'm the martyr. I do all these 
wonderful things. I get kicked, I get fucked by the FBI and whoever 
else, but I'm doing it for you. I'm your martyr and I want to be loved 
by you.' That strange dynamic is going on all the time, everywhere, and 
it has to be stopped. It can only be stopped by not running after those 
people.</p>

 he was paid $98,880; between 2011 and 2014, his salary was not reported

<p dir="auto">On January 23rd 2019, <strong>Reuters</strong> reported that Appelbaum had recently been contacted by prosecutors as part of an effort to "<a href="https://archive.fo/uhJCN#selection-353.75-353.145" rel="nofollow">pressure witnesses to testify against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange</a>," and was named in an <a href="https://archive.fo/EoDvs#selection-1429.11-2049.229" rel="nofollow">application by Assange's legal team to the Washington-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Appelbaum told Reuters that while prosecutors offered him 
broad immunity from prosecution, he had no interest in cooperating or 
testifying before a grand jury.</p>

<p dir="auto">On June 24th 2020, the <a href="https://archive.is/NZjYG" rel="nofollow">U.S. Justice Department</a> released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200704074304/https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1289641/download" rel="nofollow">a superseding indictment</a>
 against Assange, alleging that "Assange and others at WikiLeaks 
recruited and agreed with hackers to commit computer intrusions to 
benefit WikiLeaks." Appelbaum, referenced as '<a href="https://challengepower.info/superseding_indictment_-_24-06-2020" rel="nofollow">WLA-3</a>'
 in the document, is cited as one of the "co-conspirators" who engaged 
in this recruiting behaviour at three different events between 2010 and 
2015. While filing no additional charges, this greatly expands the 
timeline that Assange's extradition case will be addressing. Journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/kgosztola" rel="nofollow">Kevin Gosztola</a> <a href="https://archive.is/QQlve" rel="nofollow">noted</a>
 that "prosecutors rely heavily on statements and chat logs from 
Sigurdur 'Siggi' Thordarson and Hector Xavier Monsegur ('Sabu'), who 
were both FBI informants." Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200610090647/https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1136806131211411456" rel="nofollow"><strong>WikiLeaks</strong></a>
 had predicted that an additional indictment would be filed which used 
Thordarson "as star witness," despite him being a "convicted conman and 
sex criminal, involved in an FBI entrapment operation against 
WikiLeaks." Gosztola also pointed out that they omitted substantial 
portions of Assange's statements when quoting them as evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">At no point does the Justice Department attempt to connect
 the alleged “recruitment” of “hackers” or “leakers” to an actual 
individual, who heard these words and acted upon them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Rather than viewing this document as a wishlist generated 
by Wikileaks staff or a reflection of Assange’s personal priorities, we 
must understand that this was a publicly-generated list developed by 
contributors who felt each “wanted” document offered information that 
would be valuable to the public... But the government’s indictment, 
which names this document no less than 14 times and dedicates multiple 
pages to describing it, never explains the crowd-sourced nature of the 
Most Wanted Leaks document.</p>

<p dir="auto">In a special report by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190502051404/https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/03/wikithreat.pdf" rel="nofollow">Army Counterintelligence Center</a> in 2008, they state that <strong>WikiLeaks</strong>
 "uses its own coded software combined with Wiki, MediaWiki, OpenSSL, 
FreeNet, TOR, and PGP" as "an effective tool for collaborative 
authoring." In fact, they argued that a lack of "editorial review" could
 "create multiple legal issues for Wikileaks.org that could subject 
members to legal prosecution."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Wikileaks.org staff members and various authors and 
contributors have written numerous news articles and posted the raw data
 in spreadsheets or Structured Query Language (SQL) data base so anyone 
can examine the information, conduct research, comment upon, discuss the
 various units, see the items of equipment, see what they do, and draw 
their own conclusions about the strategic, political, military, and 
human rights significance of the information.</p>

<p dir="auto">On October 1st, York published an <a href="https://archive.vn/6CgnQ" rel="nofollow">article</a> about "<a href="https://archive.is/Il5wD" rel="nofollow">online harassment and what I've gotten wrong in the past</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Our societies are increasingly divided, a fact that leads 
to more vitriol, more anger, and more hate. Social media is part of the 
problem, but it isn't the whole problem. What we need is to take the 
holistic view, to see that social media, its architecture and design, 
maximize controversy for profit, and that there will never be a 
technological solution to stop online hate and harassment, because it is
 rooted not in code, but in human behavior. We cannot separate "real 
life" from "online." And so, whatever approach we take to combat that 
which ails us must be rooted in compassion.</p>

<p dir="auto">The document notes that the FBI “will also attempt to 
psychologically evaluate the target to determine the target’s 
motivations, mental stability and loyalties and will seek information on
 the target’s habits, hobbies, interests, vices, aspirations, emotional 
ties, and feelings concerning his country and his career and his 
employer.” The FBI declined to comment further on how its agents go 
about psychologically evaluating would-be informants.</p>
<p dir="auto">If information alone is not sufficient to induce someone 
to inform, the bureau may offer six-figure payments and even some of the
 value of any property forfeited as a result of the investigation, the 
informant guidelines make clear. Informants can make a lot of money 
working for the FBI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It is really hard to talk about Tor's action because there
 is a lack of transparency. Why does everything have to be hidden, even 
from tor-internal? Isn't that contrary to the way Tor has worked in the 
past? While I understand that the people who claim they are victims need
 to be protected and I accept the fact that their names cannot be 
disclosed, I do not understand why all the info must be kept secret from
 people who dedicate a major part of their daily lives to the Tor 
project.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Why did Tor first take action (by making Jake quit) and 
only then started an investigation? Shouldn't that be the other way 
around? Did Tor do any fact-checking before acting based on the 
allegations? Why was Jake banned from TorDev in March, and why was his 
absence not addressed officially at any moment? Why did no discussion 
about this topic happen at that point?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I cannot even point all the details (from the blogposts to
 all the refusals to talk on tor-internal) where Tor showed a worrying 
lack of transparency. I am extremely worried about the direction taken 
by the organization. This is, to be clear, not a version of the Tor 
Project I want to be associated with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The situation how the affair about Jake was handled by the
 Tor project has made me feel very uneasy. After digging through several
 material (for example
<a href="https://shiromarieke.github.io/tor" rel="nofollow">https://shiromarieke.github.io/tor</a>)
 I find that I am no longer believing in this project or trust it. 
That’s why I’m shutting down my tor relay fsingtor now. As long as the 
project stays that way it is I will no longer recommend Tor or support 
it in any ways. And I don’t think that such a project should have any 
future.</p>

<p dir="auto">Basically, this is a call to dissolve the project, it's a 
culture jamming monkey wrenching set of demands that is not a

and how it got here.</p>

<p dir="auto">I am not happy about what is going on at Tor either.  I am
 not happy about the current administration.  I am not happy about the

 am not happy that a CIA staffer got on staff without being vetted, 
either.</p>

<p dir="auto">Like Shepard, Lovecruft was also moved to '<a href="https://archive.is/YsTLJ#selection-493.0-497.169" rel="nofollow">past contributors</a>' in early July 2018 (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#isis-lovecruft"><em>Isis Lovecruft</em></a>'). On November 9th, in response to the <strong>Tor Project</strong> account tweeting about supporting the online privacy of those who are "<a href="https://archive.is/LjGGy" rel="nofollow">transgender, non-binary, or intersex</a>," Lovecruft said, "<a href="https://archive.is/BnOnN" rel="nofollow">this
 is extremely cringe inducing given how horribly your non-profit has 
treated all its trans and non-binary employees and contributors</a>." On or around <a href="https://archive.fo/mbKNc" rel="nofollow">April 5th 2019</a>, Shepard's <a href="https://archive.fo/bbMSw" rel="nofollow"><strong>Twitter</strong> account was suspended</a> for unrelated reasons.</p>
<p dir="auto">In January 2019, Steele was <a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-website-and-twitter-accounts">interviewed</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191021214100/https:/twitter.com/PacificStand/status/1087711484707250176?lang=en" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pacific Standard</strong></a>
 about her time as executive director. She described a meeting which 
Appelbaum was excluded from, where "several women... came to me during 
that meeting and told me their stories about things that had happened 
with Jake." Then, "within a couple of weeks, I heard from a woman who 
said that she was raped," most likely Komlo; therefore, this meeting was
 probably held in early 2016. She said she was "proud" of those who had 
set up the 'victim's collective' website. No mention was made of <a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#isis-lovecruft">Lovecruft</a>, one of the primary accusers, being fired from the <strong>Tor Project</strong> six months earlier.</p>
<p dir="auto">In February 2020, the journal of <a href="https://archive.is/L2Tcc" rel="nofollow">Information, Communication &amp; Society</a> published a PhD sociological study by <a href="https://archive.is/CGHy3" rel="nofollow"><strong>Cambridge Cybercrime Centre</strong></a> <a href="https://archive.is/B60Tr" rel="nofollow">post-doctoral researcher</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/GZPps" rel="nofollow">Ben Collier</a>, titled "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201203174521/https://sci-hub.st/10.1080/1369118x.2020.1732440" rel="nofollow">The power to structure: exploring social worlds of privacy, technology and power in the Tor Project</a>."
 It is based on "twenty-six qualitative interviews with people in the 
Tor community" (though only twelve anonymised individuals are quoted) 
and "extensive archival research in Tor’s mailing lists and design 
documents."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">When this research was conducted, Tor was in the process 
of recovering from a serious crisis in which a prominent community 
member had just been fired for allegedly engaging in sexual violence and
 abusive behaviour, which several participants linked to the changing 
values of the Tor Project. As a result, I sought to conduct these 
interviews sensitively, and to discuss these issues sensitively in this 
analysis, focusing on the organisational and cultural changes which 
resulted from these events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In the section on 'Cultural change and boundary 
breakdown,' Collier found that there was "a transformation in how the 
Tor community understands itself as the organisation," towards 
"professionalisation," between 2013 (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-snowden-leaks"><em>The Snowden Leaks</em></a>')
 and the years following Appelbaum's resignation. He incorrectly 
summarises that Applebaum was "fired," when in fact he resigned (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-resignation"><em>The Resignation</em></a>'),
 and lists "the installation of Shari Steele as director" as occurring 
after the board was replaced, even though Steele was appointed in 
December 2015, more than half a year earlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This has met with praise from some sections of the 
community and considerable opposition from others, and has shaken the 
détente between the social worlds of Tor... A social worlds perspective 
allows us to understand this crisis as not just a clash between groups 
within the Tor community, but as the rupture of a previously stable 
equilibrium between different ways of understanding the project.</p>

<p dir="auto">In November 2017, the <strong>European Court of Human Rights</strong> (ECHR) decided in the case of <em>EGILL EINARSSON v. ICELAND</em> that "<a href="https://archive.is/gCrgS#selection-8243.4-8267.21" rel="nofollow">public
 persons... do not have to tolerate being publicly accused of violent 
criminal acts without such statements being supported by facts</a>," on the basis that it violates his <a href="https://archive.is/gCrgS#selection-7475.4-7589.266" rel="nofollow">Article 8</a> rights.</p>
<p dir="auto">In November 2019, <a href="https://archive.is/XiAqe" rel="nofollow">Appelbaum</a> participated in the "<a href="https://archive.is/f2I9C" rel="nofollow"><em>Resistências</em></a>" program of the Lisbon &amp; Sintra Film Festival (LEFFEST'19), curated by Franco-Spanish lawyer and journalist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191121163333/https://twitter.com/anatolium" rel="nofollow">Juan Branco</a>.
 On the 16th, during a discussion with Branco, Appelbaum spoke about 
Assange's case, his regrets about the 'internet freedom' movement, and 
his experience being targeted by the surveillance state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">"<a href="https://youtu.be/r9qkNzlzSQM?t=243" rel="nofollow">Having
 proof is a lot like being innocent of a thing. You think that matters 
in this context, and it doesn't. Actually, having evidence doesn't 
change one bit about those people who suggested it wasn't real and that 
we deserve it. The evidence didn't change their opinion because they're 
authoritarians, often pretending to not be fascists, but who in fact are
 supporting things like the death penalty, very clearly for Julian and 
for other people</a>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">He also referenced the hiring of Chasteen (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#leaked-tor-internal-chat-logs"><em>Leaked Tor-Internal Chat Logs</em></a>') and Reilly's subsequent allegations of rape and harassment (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#suspension-from-the-tor-project"><em>Suspension from the Tor Project</em></a>') as an influence on his resignation from the <strong>Tor Project</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">"<a href="https://youtu.be/r9qkNzlzSQM?t=1376" rel="nofollow">I helped to build part of the 'internet freedom' world. I worked at the <strong>Tor Project</strong> for a very long time. I had a very brutal exit from the <strong>Tor Project</strong>,
 not only because of the aforementioned accusations against me, but also
 because... Before I was accused of these things, I discovered that 
someone was an undercover CIA officer with a current clearance. That's 
really dangerous. It really sucks, but after that happened, the person 
who hired that CIA officer actually accused me of rape. A very important
 detail is, I've never had any romantic interactions with that person at
 all. They withdrew the accusation pretty quickly, but the damage was 
already done. It laid the groundwork for later accusing me of other 
crimes. So I want to say that I am very skeptical of this 21st century 
statecraft that the State Department has pushed, and the 'internet 
freedom' movement as a whole</a>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Branco, as a legal advisor, had visited Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy, particularly in relation to <a href="https://archive.is/Gw9xf" rel="nofollow">an attempt to seek asylum in France</a>. Since November 21st, Branco has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191201134220/https:/twitter.com/anatolium/status/1197500181291393024?lang=en" rel="nofollow">sharing surveillance footage</a> of the embassy that had been made available through <a href="https://archive.is/LXlzc" rel="nofollow">the exposure of Spanish security company <strong>UC Global</strong></a>.

<p dir="auto">A few days later, Reilly still mocked the idea that he was a "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191122132249/https:/twitter.com/akareilly/status/1197451329418993664" rel="nofollow">political exile</a>" and accused him of taking credit for someone else's work, without any specifics.

Quintin suggested that <a href="https://archive.is/ZvDX1" rel="nofollow">rotten fruit should have been thrown</a>. Galperin (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#electronic-frontier-foundation"><em>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em></a>') characterized the talks as "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191122131355/https:/twitter.com/evacide/status/1197366794165481472?lang=en" rel="nofollow">classic sexual abuser comeback tour material</a>," and <a href="https://archive.is/hXAmC" rel="nofollow">reiterated</a> that he should "engage [in] a good faith restorative justice process with all of your victims." Chasteen responded, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191122132719/https:/twitter.com/davidschasteen/status/1197605056821915649?lang=en" rel="nofollow">This is the correct take</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">In July 2020, <a href="https://archive.ph/o84uf" rel="nofollow">York</a>
 tweeted that people were "trying to revive Appelbaum's career," and 
"his only remaining fans are looney tunes" and "second-rate 
journalists." She also declared, "I can promise, he will never be 
welcome in the digital rights community again. Oh and uh... I've got 
plenty of as-yet-unseen receipts." Reilly would also continue to 
reference the allegations against Appelbaum and <a href="https://archive.is/Csns1" rel="nofollow">Assange</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">On September 24th 2020, an online magazine of <a href="https://archive.is/sQQUS" rel="nofollow">Heise Gruppe</a> published <a href="https://archive.is/cmhtB" rel="nofollow">an article</a>
 exploring how the U.S. prosecution criminalised talks at events in 
Germany -- Chaos Computer Club in December 2013, re:publica in May 2014,
 a Rosa Luxemburg Foundation conference in June 2015 -- as part of the 
conspiracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Die Nennung von drei Events zwischen den Jahren 2013 und 
2015 ist nicht nur beachtlich, weil die netzpolitische Szene in 
Deutschland von US-Stellen beobachtet wurde. [The mention of three 
events between 2013 and 2015 is remarkable, not only because the 
net-politics scene in Germany was monitored by U.S. agencies.] Die 
erweiterte Anklageschrift weist vor allem darauf hin, dass die US-Justiz
 die Strafverfolgung neben Assange offenbar auf weitere 
WikiLeaks-Mitarbeiter ausweiten will. [The superceding indictment 
indicates above all that the U.S. justice system apparently seeks to 
extend the criminal prosecution beyond Assange to other WikiLeaks 
staff.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The article was also accompanied by <a href="https://archive.is/4YkfD" rel="nofollow">a statement</a> by Appelbaum himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Diese Anklage ist nichts als ein Lawfare und Teil einer 
umfassenderen Strategie politischer Angriffe auf WikiLeaks, auf Personen
 im Umfeld von WikiLeaks und auf den investigativen Journalismus als 
Ganzes. [This indictment is nothing more than lawfare and part of a 
broader strategy of political attacks on WikiLeaks, on individuals 
associated with WikiLeaks, and on investigative journalism as a whole.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">On October 3rd 2020, during the seventh annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201005044840/https://digital-totality.hcpp.cz/" rel="nofollow">Hackers Congress</a> at Paralelni Polis, <a href="https://youtu.be/9Yolhny77BQ?t=7421" rel="nofollow">Appelbaum</a> again spoke about Assange's case, the grand jury, and the fallout from the <strong>Tor Project</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">For example, to give you an idea of his character: when I 
understood that the grand jury wanted me to testify against Julian 
Assange, I called Julian and I told him. I told him, "I have been told 
that if I do not testify against you, they will come and extradite me 
from Europe, and I will probably die in an American prison or be locked 
up indefinitely," as Chelsea Manning at the time was. I told him, "I 
have not been home in many years. I do not want to do this."</p>
<p dir="auto">You would expect a selfish jerk to do something like 
telling me what to do in that situation, something that is in his best 
interest. But that's not what he did. He made a moral appeal, not to me 
but to the standard that we should all set. He said, "The Tor Project 
has taken away your reputation and name. They have tried to say that you
 have no right to speak in public anymore, that you have no moral 
standing, that you are nobody, that you are nothing. And now the 
Department of Justice has given you a chance to show the world who you 
really are. So it's up to you to decide what choice you want to make. 
It's up to you to decide what you want to live with, and what you can't 
live with."</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">On September 26th 2021, <a href="https://archive.is/jTabN" rel="nofollow"><strong>Yahoo! News</strong></a>
 published an investigation "based on conversations with more than 30 
former U.S. officials — eight of whom described details of the CIA’s 
proposals to abduct Assange — [that] reveals for the first time one of 
the most contentious intelligence debates of the Trump presidency and 
exposes new details about the U.S. government’s war on WikiLeaks." Their
 sources claim that after the Snowden leaks in 2013, "top intelligence 
officials lobbied the White House to redefine WikiLeaks — and some 
high-profile journalists — as 'information brokers,' which would have 
opened up the use of more investigative tools against them," including 
Greenwald and Poitras. After the publication of the Democratic Party 
emails in 2016, and then the Vault 7 release in 2017:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The CIA now considered people affiliated with WikiLeaks 
valid targets for various types of spying, including close-in technical 
collection — such as bugs — sometimes enabled by in-person espionage, 
and “remote operations,” meaning, among other things, the hacking of 
WikiLeaks members’ devices from afar, according to former intelligence 
officials.</p>
<p dir="auto">... The CIA’s designation of WikiLeaks as a non-state 
hostile intelligence service enabled “the doubling down of efforts 
globally and domestically on collection” against the group, Evanina 
said. Those efforts included tracking the movements and communications 
of Assange and other top WikiLeaks figures by “tasking more on the tech 
side, recruiting more on the human side,” said another former senior 
counterintelligence official.</p>
<p dir="auto">... By mid-2017, U.S. spies had excellent intelligence on 
numerous WikiLeaks members and associates, not just on Assange, said 
former officials. This included what these individuals were saying and 
who they were saying it to, where they were traveling or going to be at a
 given date and time, and what platforms these individuals were 
communicating on, according to former officials.</p>
<p dir="auto">U.S. spy agencies developed good intelligence on WikiLeaks
 associates’ “patterns of life,” particularly their travels within 
Europe, said a former national security official. U.S. intelligence was 
particularly keen on information documenting travel by WikiLeaks 
associates to Russia or countries in Russia’s orbit, according to the 
former official.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the CIA, the new designation meant Assange and 
WikiLeaks would go from “a target of collection to a target of 
disruption,” said a former senior CIA official. Proposals began 
percolating upward within the CIA and the NSC to undertake various 
disruptive activities — the core of “offensive counterintelligence” — 
against WikiLeaks. These included paralyzing its digital infrastructure,
 disrupting its communications, provoking internal disputes within the 
organization by planting damaging information, and stealing WikiLeaks 
members’ electronic devices, according to three former officials.</p>

<p dir="auto">On March 25th 2022, Appelbaum's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220329071124/https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/communication-in-a-world-of-pervasive-surveillance-sources-and-me" rel="nofollow">PhD thesis</a> was published and signalled that he had successfully graduated from Eindhoven.

On March 30th, Garrett asserted, "<a href="https://archive.ph/WIWei" rel="nofollow">I managed to get a PhD without sexually assaulting anyone so I assume mine is more valuable than his</a>," and contended that <a href="https://archive.ph/AwjVn" rel="nofollow">he should not be allowed</a> to continue lecturing at <em>Berner Fachhochschule</em> (BFH) either.</p>
<p dir="auto">In June, Reilly tweeted <a href="https://archive.ph/67rLX" rel="nofollow">a long thread</a>
 criticising those who call for 'due process' regarding sexual 
misconduct allegations. She claimed that "the founder of a tech NGO 
quite literally said TO ME that: the abuser would attempt to damage the 
organisation, he needed to go, but he couldn't be fired, so he would be 
handed off to a graduate program in cryptography at a technical 
university in the Netherlands." York then quote-tweeted this and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.ph/dOCH6" rel="nofollow">Looking 
at you, Appelbaum. Your apology tour is directed at all the wrong

<p dir="auto">In a few tweets, Lovecruft had <a href="https://archive.is/iwFcO" rel="nofollow">accused</a> Todd of being an "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180515182909/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/996263395602055168?lang=en" rel="nofollow">abuser</a>," specifically by means of "<a href="https://archive.fo/cPzFx" rel="nofollow">rape and assault</a>."

 a few of which Lovecruft liked. The lawsuit then notes that Lovecruft 
"blocked Todd from viewing her Twitter profile" after he had said that 
he didn't know what was true regarding the controversy as a whole, 
likely referring to <a href="https://archive.fo/NPCNr" rel="nofollow">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://archive.fo/gidaw#selection-5909.0-5909.109" rel="nofollow">August 18th 2016</a>.

 he "observed" Todd "persistently pursuing a female friend of mine," who
 then said "she was very uncomfortable and asking if I could help her

Fitzgibbon quote-tweeted with: "<a href="https://archive.is/I6YfW" rel="nofollow">Closure</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">On August 5th 2019, Lovecruft <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190806102116/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.31.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">responded to Todd's opposition</a>,
 asserting that he had not satisfied the "evidentiary burden in opposing
 the anti-SLAPP motion" or showed that Lovecruft "fabricated evidence," 
and noted that they were "submitting a new declaration by Doe in which 
she identifies herself" <a href="https://archive.is/Yejko#selection-14747.0-14747.305" rel="nofollow">under seal</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In arguing that the allegations against Appelbaum 
constituted a public controversy, they state that "Appelbaum’s own 
employer found the allegations credible enough to terminate him." As was
 the case with the article by Lee and Currier (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-intercept"><em>The Intercept</em></a>'), this is an inaccurate summary of events, since it implies that Appelbaum left the <strong>Tor Project</strong>
 after the allegations were investigated. Appelbaum was forced to resign
 on or around May 25th 2016, whereas Steele stated that they would 
engage with an independent investigator on June 4th, and then announced 
that the investigation had concluded on July 25th, two months later. 
Initially, Steele did not say whether she considered the allegations to 
be "credible," rather they did "<a href="https://archive.is/uOTpp" rel="nofollow">not know exactly what happened here. We don't have all the facts</a>." The exact results of the investigation, which reportedly did not consider any input from Appelbaum, remain private (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#tor-project-concludes-investigation"><em>Tor Project Concludes Investigation</em></a>'). In July 2018, Lovecruft themself was terminated from their position at the <strong>Tor Project</strong>, under the same executive director, for making "<a href="https://archive.is/ql6do#selection-415.176-415.460" rel="nofollow">unacceptable... public, verbal attacks on community members</a>" (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#isis-lovecruft"><em>Isis Lovecruft</em></a>' and '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-tor-project"><em>The Tor Project</em></a>').</p>
<p dir="auto">They also argued that by "expressing doubt and

 "the court indicated that it would consider Defendant’s legal

in a summary judgement motion after the parties had the opportunity to 
conduct discovery," based on the precedent of <em>Planned Parenthood v. Center for Medical Progress</em>.
 It was requested that "each side must submit an opening brief" on the 
merits and standards of the case by September 12th, and submit replies 
by September 19th. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191203154747/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.48.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">full transcript</a> of the hearing was released later.</p>
<p dir="auto">Both parties submitted their supplemental briefs on the 12th. Todd's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190912181340/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.49.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">accepted</a>
 that he the plaintiff needed to show a "probability of prevailing on 
the challenged claims," demonstrating "a minimum level of legal

that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact," because 
"when an anti-SLAPP motion challenges the factual sufficiency of a

 that, while the court should apply California’s two-prong

<p dir="auto">On October 2nd, <strong>The Verge</strong> writer <a href="https://twitter.com/russellbrandom" rel="nofollow">Russell Brandom</a> categorized the lawsuit and Appelbaum's declaration as part of "<a href="https://archive.fo/Gd4h2" rel="nofollow">a troubling backlash to the anti-harassment movement</a>," amid "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191004113357/https://twitter.com/russellbrandom/status/1179454566204608512?lang=en" rel="nofollow">a long story about MeToo backlash and the limits of the court system</a>."
 Todd disagreed within the article about that characterisation: "My 
lawsuit isn’t about silencing victims because Lovecruft isn’t a victim 
in this case."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.fo/Gd4h2#selection-2391.0-2397.370" rel="nofollow">Reached for comment by <em>The Verge</em>,
 Todd insisted he filed the suit in order to clear his name. “The court 
system exists to provide an avenue for relief precisely for situations 
like this one,” Todd said. “In this lawsuit, an impartial judge or jury,
 not affected by an Internet mob and one-sided online fundraising 
projects, can look at the evidence and determine whether Isis Lovecruft 
has defamed me.”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">On January 6th 2020, Lovecruft tweeted about "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200107205056/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/1214298799109074944?lang=en" rel="nofollow">your duty as an ally to report it to the organisers if you see a known abuser in attendance</a>," and "if the organisers do nothing, it’s also your duty to remove the abuser from the conference." This was in reference to <a href="https://archive.ph/Bubhb" rel="nofollow">Kobeïssi</a>, presumably because he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200108123912/https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1214222925881987073?lang=en" rel="nofollow">planning</a> to attend the '<a href="https://archive.is/hPdIF" rel="nofollow">Real World Crypto Symposium</a>' in <a href="https://archive.is/0PUtd" rel="nofollow">New York City</a>. Lovecruft <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200106220837/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/1214300886819729408" rel="nofollow">claimed</a> that he had admitted to "sexually assaulting me at a conference in Rio in 2012" within his declaration for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730015012/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.27.0.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>Todd v. Lovecruft</em></a>. (At some later point, Lovecruft <a href="https://archive.is/8C3gf" rel="nofollow">deleted this tweet</a>.)
 However, Kobeïssi had only stated that he "politely kissed Defendant on
 the cheek (as relatives would greet each other)" during "social 
activities outside of conferences." According to Garrett, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200109014755/https:/twitter.com/mjg59/status/1215063776812306432?lang=en" rel="nofollow">reported Kobeïssi to organizers</a>, the event would not remove him unless someone had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200108213626/https:/twitter.com/mjg59/status/1215018081589825538?lang=en" rel="nofollow">a restraining order</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">On the same day, Judge Ryu filed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200108143447/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.53.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">her order on Lovecruft's motion to strike</a>.
 She "agrees with Todd that there are two types of defamatory messages 
at issue: Lovecruft’s statements that Todd sexually assaulted and/or 
raped someone other than Lovecruft, and Lovecruft’s statements that Todd
 engaged in sexual misconduct toward Lovecruft." The court considered 
four statements that had been submitted and concluded that, if they are 
false, "Todd has made a prima facie case" that the second statement is "<a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/defamation-per-quod/" rel="nofollow">defamation per quod</a>," while the first, third, and fourth statements are "<a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/defamation-per-se/" rel="nofollow">defamation per se</a>."
 Because "Todd has not made a prima facie showing that Lovecruft failed 
to use reasonable care in accusing Todd of raping or sexually assaulting
 someone other than Lovecruft," they granted the motion to strike 
regarding those statements. However, "the motion is denied as to 
Lovecruft’s personal accusation against Todd in the Fourth Statement." A
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200108150554/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.54.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">case management hearing</a> was set for March 4th.</p>
<p dir="auto">On February 26th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200307205603/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.57.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">a joint case management statement</a>
 was filed. While Todd stated that he "seeks to conduct discovery," 
Lovecruft asserted that "any effort by Todd to conduct discovery 
regarding any incident or communication outside of Lovecruft’s 
statement(s)" would "invade Lovecruft’s rights to free expression, free 
association, and privacy; would similarly invade third parties’ rights; 
would be more harmful and prejudicial than probative; would constitute  
harassment" and more. They proposed a schedule for various deadlines, 
includng for trial commencement in July 2021. On March 5th, Judge Ryu 
signed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200310215017/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.62.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">the case management and pretrial order</a>; the case was also referred to <a href="https://archive.is/l1MGp" rel="nofollow">Judge Robert M. Illman</a>, who would handle the settlement conference on June 3rd.</p>
<p dir="auto">On May 20th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200527112614/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.73.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">a joint letter</a>
 regarding discovery &amp; evidentiary disputes was filed. The letter 
contained arguments on two main issues: how to present the allegedly 
defamatory tweet to the jury, and the admissibility of evidence about 
Lovecruft’s accusations against third parties, in the context of 
"establishing Lovecruft’s knowledge, intent, plan, scheme, and modus 
operandi" regarding Todd. Lovecruft had characterized their allegations 
as pertaining to "sexual harassment and minor battery, not rape." A 
hearing to discuss this letter was scheduled for June 25th, but on June 
5th, following the settlement conference, the docket noted that "<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/14868600/todd-v-lovecruft/#entry-76" rel="nofollow">the
 court has received notice that this case has settled. All case

<p dir="auto">On or around June 15th, Lovecruft tweeted, "<a href="https://archive.is/9lb1y" rel="nofollow">While Peter Todd and I were involved in litigation, to be clear, Peter Todd never raped me or sexually assaulted me</a>." They also published <a href="https://archive.is/Nfh3a" rel="nofollow">an update</a> to the <a href="https://archive.is/azxX2" rel="nofollow"><strong>GoFundMe</strong> campaign</a>,
 which specified that both parties had "settled the case" on June 3rd, 
"reaching final written agreement on June 10, 2020." They were still 
seeking nearly $22,000 to "cover Lovecruft’s legal expenses." Six days 
before the settlement, on May 28th, they announced that they had "<a href="https://archive.is/FqGyd" rel="nofollow">proposed to one of my partners and we just bought and moved into our first house</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">On June 16th, Todd <a href="https://archive.is/FcI1Y" rel="nofollow">confirmed</a> that this "ridiculously expensive" lawsuit had been <a href="https://archive.is/kxWjf" rel="nofollow">settled</a> and shared <a href="https://archive.is/bis0D" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/xcmfc" rel="nofollow">pages</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/ZEWCh" rel="nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/95yJd" rel="nofollow">the</a> <a href="https://archive.vn/08OuX" rel="nofollow">agreement</a>.
 He noted that he would be "checking with my lawyers about what I can 
say about it and the evidence we got in discovery. No NDA, so should be 
able to do a full writeup." The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200617010034/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.77.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">stipulation for dismissal</a> was entered into the docket.</p>
<p dir="auto">In <a href="https://archive.is/YyjT4" rel="nofollow">defending Lovecruft's side</a> of the settlement, Garrett <a href="https://archive.is/04QNr" rel="nofollow">repeated the allegations</a> against Appelbaum and Kobeïssi, and proceeded to argue about who was being "<a href="https://archive.is/bcJP1" rel="nofollow">dishonest</a>." When Kobeïssi claimed that his own "day in court" was an "obvious impossibility for me," Garrett <a href="https://archive.is/uKnbL" rel="nofollow">responded</a>,
 "I'm sure that the French immigration authorities will be pleased to 
learn about your history of sexual assault... To be clear, I'm not going
 to do anything here - I don't snitch. But if you want to avoid any of 
your victims interfering with your immigration, you're going to have to 
deal with that yourself." This threat is reminiscent of the account from
 'Kit' in October 2016, where they claimed to witness Lovecruft 
researching how Appelbaum "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018225321/https://schrodingersk1t.github.io/" rel="nofollow">would be deported and would never be able to get a visa in any European country if he got convicted of a violent crime</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">He and <a href="https://archive.is/tR9Cy" rel="nofollow">several</a> <a href="https://archive.is/PhEAN" rel="nofollow">others</a> have misrepresented the nature of the settlement and Judge Ryu's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200108143447/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.53.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">ruling from January</a>
 in different ways. Defamation is not considered 'protected speech,' and
 the court found that all four of Lovecruft's statements "reasonably 
convey a defamatory meaning." However, as the summary judgement had been
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913083240/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.50.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">requested</a>
 so early in the case, the court was unable to "prejudge the truth of 
the Statements" and "Todd has not made a prima facie showing that 
Lovecruft failed to use reasonable care" regarding their reporting of 
allegations from third parties, or that he was entitled to "special 
damages." Therefore "that inquiry is outside the purview of the court’s 
analysis at this stage." A formal trial was scheduled for July 2021, but
 has been cancelled due to the settlement, which did not require either 
party to retract statements made.</p>
<p dir="auto">He also claimed to have knowledge about Todd's lawyers' views of their client: "<a href="https://archive.vn/DF22D" rel="nofollow">I understand that your lawyers thought you were an idiot</a>," and "<a href="https://archive.is/NcReb" rel="nofollow">your lawyers wanted to get rid of you so you didn't tarnish their reputation as effective ambulance chasers</a>." Neither <a href="https://archive.is/qcNMy/image" rel="nofollow">Jeffrey Rosenfeld</a> nor <a href="https://archive.vn/ODdUu/image" rel="nofollow">Karl Kronenberger</a> appear to have made any such statements.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.is/dP51d" rel="nofollow">Wilcox</a> published <a href="https://archive.is/rlvLT" rel="nofollow">a Medium post</a> that focused on Jane Doe's allegations and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190716120922/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.20.2.pdf" rel="nofollow">his declaration</a>,
 concluding "I don’t want to give anyone an opportunity to sow confusion
 by changing the topic to be about me." Yet he neglected to mention 
that, prior to settlement, the court had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200108143447/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.53.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">already decided</a>
 to not focus on the allegations from / about third parties; in that 
vein, Wilcox's declaration was to be "excluded as inadmissible hearsay. 
The non-hearsay portions of the declaration are unnecessary for the 
court’s analysis." In footnotes, Appelbaum's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730004551/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.25.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">declaration</a> was similarly deemed "not relevant to this motion."</p>
<p dir="auto">In their coverage of the case settlement, <a href="https://archive.is/ZLGGD" rel="nofollow"><strong>CoinDesk</strong></a> falsely reported that "two Jane Does made filings in the case." While Lovecruft <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200616173508/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.20.3.pdf" rel="nofollow">claimed</a> to have spoken to two women, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190716122811/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.20.4.pdf" rel="nofollow">only one filed a declaration</a> with the court. <strong>CoinDesk</strong>
 also stated that "Todd denied both charges," when there were no charges
 to begin with, as this was a civil lawsuit. While they subsequently 
fixed these errors, Todd says the article "<a href="https://archive.is/RPsvT" rel="nofollow">also misquotes me, which Coindesk has refused to fix</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">Less than <a href="https://archive.is/9lEwH" rel="nofollow">one day</a> after the settlement was publicy announced, <a href="https://archive.vn/veQFy" rel="nofollow">Lovecruft</a> <a href="http://archive.is/JzQjI" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a>:</p>

He pointed to <a href="https://archive.is/eddl0" rel="nofollow">a blog post</a> published by Lovecruft on June 28th 2012, after the <a href="https://archive.is/HRLBh" rel="nofollow">Rio de Janeiro</a> <a href="https://archive.is/02v85" rel="nofollow">RightsCon</a> event that they <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200713151342/https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimkillock/albums/72157630106915556" rel="nofollow">both attended</a>, when the <a href="https://archive.is/8iJbA" rel="nofollow">alleged assault</a> supposedly occurred. In contrast, Lovecruft's "nice" <a href="https://archive.is/fIj8J" rel="nofollow">story</a> recounts how they and other <strong>Tor Project</strong> people affectionately pressured "my friend Nadim" to implement mpOTR (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#len-sassaman-and-plagiarism-allegations"><em>Len Sassaman and Plagiarism Allegations</em></a>'), including with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190217080917if_/https://twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/218408328148156416" rel="nofollow">an email script</a>. Lovecruft joked about this as "<a href="https://archive.is/9xMVI" rel="nofollow">the minor hell I've been putting @kaepora through</a>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">So, myself and some other people involved with Tor, and 
stuff and crypto and stuff, took to sending messages to Nadim in all 
sorts of fanciful and prankish ways, just to say “IMPLEMENT MPOTR.” 
Notes under the hotel room door in Brazil; late night phone calls; 
sharpie on his face after diving over a conference room table to tackle 
him. That sort of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">He states that since February 2019, he has "suffered 
profound and perhaps permanent psychological trauma," been "physically 
assaulted," and "banned from conferences and workshops without any 
recourse" as a result of the "false accusations."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I made sure in my testimony to indicate that I could not 
comment on the accusations Isis had made against others, as I had no 
certain way of knowing whether they were true or false. In fact, in 
2016, I originally believed Isis’s claims against some other individual 
in my domain and even supported them. However, given Isis’s own claims 
about me, I find it difficult to personally continue to believe their 
claims about others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Lovecruft <a href="https://archive.is/JeZrK" rel="nofollow">re-shared</a> their prior allegations, further claimed that Kobeïssi was "<a href="https://archive.is/NImyS" rel="nofollow">mass mobilising to get me blocked at the moment</a>," and that they were being "<a href="https://archive.is/sfGci" rel="nofollow">sucked down into the swamp of dealing with wellknown abusers in infosec</a>." They then stated: "<a href="https://archive.is/8XKXv" rel="nofollow">idk these three i am not so sure they’re ever going to find any redemption at this point, i suspect there’s only destruction</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">On or around August 5th, Lovecruft quoted <a href="https://archive.is/RnObE" rel="nofollow">Reilly</a> when referring to Appelbaum, Kobeïssi, and Bernstein as "<a href="https://archive.is/3sxrZ" rel="nofollow">some of the primary sociopaths and enablers in cryptography</a>." Once again, they falsely claimed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190730015012/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340308/gov.uscourts.cand.340308.27.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">Kobeïssi</a> had "admitted under penalty of perjury in federal supreme court that he" non-consenually "<a href="https://archive.is/IBjd7" rel="nofollow">stuck his tongue down my throat</a>." When Kobeïssi countered that this was "<a href="https://archive.is/DDciO" rel="nofollow">a complete lie</a>," he was blocked. (At some later point, Lovecruft <a href="https://archive.ph/HnnaA" rel="nofollow">deleted this tweet</a>.)</p>
<p dir="auto">On August 24th, <a href="https://archive.vn/hMdv2" rel="nofollow">Todd</a>
 shared that he had been "uninvited from the Monero Konference" in 
February 2019 after "some donors from the Monero community and some 
members of the board have expressed concerns about certain recent 
allegations made against" him. In February 2022, after he had been 
announced as <a href="https://archive.is/pZC6V" rel="nofollow">a speaker</a> for an upcoming Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Nicole Dobrow subtweeted that they had given "<a href="https://archive.is/GNhap" rel="nofollow">a speaking spot to a known rapist</a>," citing <a href="https://archive.is/YzmcG" rel="nofollow">a thread on the lawsuit</a>, and that this constituted "<a href="https://archive.is/MKwad" rel="nofollow">hostility to women and gender minorities</a>." Dobrow claimed that Todd had "<a href="https://archive.is/Lo75a" rel="nofollow">paid an undisclosed amount of money to settle</a>," which had not been listed as a condition for either side in their <a href="https://archive.is/kxWjf" rel="nofollow">settlement agreement</a>. Todd replied: "<a href="https://archive.is/OZomC" rel="nofollow">That
 is false. I did not pay anything to anyone. Anyway, the conference 
you're alluding to is welcome to do their own investigation</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">In February 2021, when Lovecruft vaguely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210213021728/https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/pull/338" rel="nofollow">accused</a>
 de Valence of "violations of the Rust Community Code of Conduct" and 
"repeatedly displaying unacceptable behaviours towards several people" 
(see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#isis-lovecruft"><em>Isis Lovecruft</em></a>'), Todd tweeted that "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210213144637/https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1360534681528242183" rel="nofollow">he is one of the people who knows first hand that Lovecruft fabricated assault allegations against me</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">During April and May, Todd and Garrett <a href="https://archive.is/NXiVY" rel="nofollow">continued to debate</a>
 about the plausibility of Lovecruft's claims. Initially, Todd shared 
more Twitter direct message screenshots pertaining to conversations with
 Lovecruft <a href="https://archive.ph/MQ6Y5" rel="nofollow">in</a> <a href="https://archive.ph/xEoGF" rel="nofollow">November</a> <a href="https://archive.is/fjHma" rel="nofollow">2014</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/xbqlA" rel="nofollow">October 2015</a>. Todd then <a href="https://archive.ph/TZWpY" rel="nofollow">shared</a> the whole Twitter direct message history between <a href="https://archive.is/SBIur/049c0f140a33a10f1d65f6f8b34c6894a97ab128.png" rel="nofollow">October 2014 and April 2016</a>, IRC logs between <a href="https://archive.org/download/todd-vs-lovecruft/irc-freenode/" rel="nofollow">December 2014 and October 2015</a>, and Pond messages between <a href="https://archive.org/download/todd-vs-lovecruft/pond-msgs/" rel="nofollow">October 2015 and May 2016</a>, as part of "<a href="https://archive.is/Sybyf" rel="nofollow">making public more of the evidence with Isis</a>."</p>
<p dir="auto">In June, Todd shared this investigation in relation to the hiring of Chasteen by the <strong>Tor Project</strong> (see '<a href="https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#leaked-tor-internal-chat-logs"><em>Leaked Tor-Internal Chat Logs</em></a>'). Several days later, <a href="https://archive.is/j5oGE" rel="nofollow">Reilly</a> replied to both <a href="https://archive.is/hh2S8" rel="nofollow">dismiss</a> <a href="https://archive.is/lLp0g" rel="nofollow">concern</a> about those circumstances and argue that Appelbaum was responsible for making the community vulnerable to those threats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Super secret spy conspiracies don’t begin with someone 
saying “Just so you know, I was really working for the CIA” then going 
away when asked. In other words, respecting consent. Which means several
 rapists in infosec could learn from spooks.</p>
<p dir="auto">... Someone who sexually harasses colleagues who are 
trying to do the work, drives away open source code contributions, and 
sabotages non-government funding is a saboteur. If Jake had a CIA agent 
assigned to him, the spook would be sitting back, feet up, drinking 
martinis all day.</p>
