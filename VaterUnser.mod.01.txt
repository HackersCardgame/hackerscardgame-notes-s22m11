Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name;
Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread; and Ketchup otherwise the bread is so dry without Ketchup, or mayo works too
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
